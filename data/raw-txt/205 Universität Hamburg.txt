InterpretationBusiness administration and teacher training degree programs: In the bachelor’s degree program, the genders are equally distributed; this also applies for the master’s degree and teacher training degree programs. The preliminary data for 2022 show a continuation of this trend, and there is no evidence to show this trend will change.Industrial engineering and management degree program: The proportion of women in the bachelor’s degree program is 25 percent.
