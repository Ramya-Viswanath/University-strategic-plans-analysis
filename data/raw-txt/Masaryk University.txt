Ladies and gentlemen,
You have in your hands the 
Masaryk University Strategic 
Plan for 2021–2028, a fundamental 
conceptual development document 
determining the direction of our 
university in education, research, 
its social role and infrastructural 
development in the coming years, 
which is the result of intensive 
university  -wide debate.
I consider this strategy to be an 
important milestone in my work as 
rector and I am glad that we have 
managed its preparation through 
university  -wide discussion, despite 
everything taking place in this 
period of crisis. When I took over 
the rector’s office in September 
2019, little did I think that we, as 
a university and society, would 
face such a serious epidemic. The 
coronavirus crisis is testing our 
prudence, resilience, coherence, 
foresight and will. However 
I believe that we will manage 
everything and that we can face the 
coming years in the hope that we 
will emerge all the stronger from 
this unprecedented crisis. I also 
believe that the Masaryk University 
Strategic Plan for 2021–2028 creates 
the basic ideological and conceptual 
preconditions for further growth 
and development and shows a clear 
direction for our university.I would like to take this opportu -
nity to thank all the deans, all the 
directors of parts of the university, 
all colleagues from our university 
staff and students who have been 
involved in thinking about the 
future of our university and put 
in work preparing this strategic 
document. I really appreciate that, 
as a university, we can look for 
a common vision and speak with 
one voice. And I am also pleased 
that our new, tenth faculty – the 
Faculty of Pharmacy – also took 
part in the preparation of the 
strategy. Its establishment in 
2020 was an important strategic 
and developmental step for our 
university.
In my inaugural address in the 
autumn of 2019, I mentioned two 
fundamental factors I consider 
important for the functioning of 
a university: movement and time. 
I think that every wise institution 
must move forward, must be able 
to anticipate subsequent events, 
and should allow for previously 
unsuspected interconnections 
of its individual components. To 
be dynamic, agile and creative as 
a whole. And time is a fundamental 
variable; which in practice means 
that it is impossible to have endless 
discussions and postpone decisions; 
to wait for the most opportune 
time, which may never come.I believe that Masaryk University 
has shown that it can be a dynamic, 
versatile and creative institution. 
And at the same time an institution 
that can make timely decisions and 
choose the right solutions.
I think that for a community such 
as our university, it remains im -
perative not only to have a common 
vision as an academic community, 
but also to be coherent and united in 
today’s “fluid” world. To work together 
for academic freedom, to ensure aca -
demic integrity, to be a critical insti -
tution in society and to be a prudent 
voice of reason in a world where it is 
often lacking. Above all to simply be 
what the university is supposed to be 
in the deepest sense – a community of 
ideas, values and spirit.
T.G. Masaryk said: “A person must 
find their way. If they truly seek it, 
they’ll quickly find it. But then they 
have to hold on or they’ll lose it.”
I think we, as Masaryk University, 
have been seeking – and we are 
seeking together.
And that we have found something 
together – and continue to do so. Let 
the Masaryk University Strategic 
Plan for 2021–2028 be proof of this.
