CENTRAL CAMPUS LEVEL STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
[1]  Distinctive, transformative research and scholarship
[2]  A rigorous, engaging, and empowering learning environment
[3]  A welcoming, inclusive, and collaborative community
[4]  Advancement of the public good
[5]  Sustainability for climate action and environmental justice
The central campus administration must provide the foundation 
for the faculty and staff in the schools, colleges, and other units 
to achieve the goals laid out in their respective strategic plans. 
The matrix below identifies three strategic goals for building 
that foundation. Within each central campus strategic goal, 
there are 2-5 broad objectives, key initiatives to support those 
objectives, initial specific action items to further the objectives, and metrics by which we can gauge our progress and develop 
additional action items. The senior administrators listed as the 
lead coordinators are responsible for working with the deans and 
other unit leaders to provide resources and services in support of 
the objectives that each school/college/unit sets for itself and to 
facilitate coordination and collaboration for multidisciplinary and 
cross-campus initiatives.PILLARS OF OUR MISSION:UCR 2030
The numbers in brackets after each initiative indicate the relevant pillar(s).
*Sustainability is currently an ad hoc Senate committee. There is a campus administrative Committee on Sustainability.
** UCR Staff Assembly is an association of many employees dedicated to promoting the interests and welfare of all UCR staff.
