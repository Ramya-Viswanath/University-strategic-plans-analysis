To achieve the positioning desired, 95% of the strategy of promotion of activities, and fundraising campaigns of the Foundation will be developed, executed and evaluated online; offline strategies like POP (among others) can result inefficient in terms of cost and value. It is also planned to carry out face-to-face encounters among alumni where is possible to donate in situ.     Throughout these campaigns and events, the corporation aims to yearly gather funds near to $200,000.00. This goal will be more achievable if the organization has the status of exempt entity.

5	 2. Antecedents   ABCU Foundation Inc. is a non-profit organization created on December 16th, 2016 by members of Universidad Católica Andrés Bello —UCAB—. This corporation was formed exclusively with charitable, educational, religious or scientific purposes within the established in Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code.    ABCU Foundation Inc. is located in Miami, Florida. Its headquarters are situated at 7900 Oak Lane. Suite 400. Miami Lakes. Florida 33016. URL: www.abcufoundation.org, Social Networks @abcufoundation Phone +17864565037. Email: abcufoundation@gmail.com  Our corporation is dedicated to improve people’s lives and to support their sustainable development by increasing the opportunities of each person interested to access higher education, and also by supporting the development of capacities in higher education systems in the world. All these align our organization with the sustainable development objectives of the United Nations, to which it is highly committed.    To achieve these goals, the corporation will initially work in coordination with students, professors, authorities, and alumni of UCAB —Venezuelan non-profit institution which is our most important strategic ally—, granting subventions, promoting academic exchange with universities in the US, promoting the transfer of technology and knowhow with universities in the US, and giving other kind of contributions to support education and sustainable developments in Venezuela and around the world.   Our strategy is based in the development of a robust network of collaborators settled in the United States of America, specifically in the South of Florida. The idea is to establish a constant communication channel to inform them about the situation and achievements of the institution, to offer them online professional training opportunities, to give consulting solutions applied to their enterprises; and, on the other hand, to request their cooperation in the achievement of the mission of the Foundation, which is to promote the increase of the opportunities for anyone interested to access higher education of quality, and the development of capacities in the higher education systems in the region and the world, throughout initiatives that integrate financial and academic support.

6	 3. Products and Services  Considering that the corporation works in close coordination with its most important strategic ally, UCAB, the corporation decides to offer through its different dissemination media —web page www.abcufoundation.org, social networks: @abcufoundation (Twitter, IG y FB) and newsletters— opportune information and institutional support to alumni, friends and, in general, to everyone interested, about the following matters:   ü Academic cooperation agreements signed with foreign universities that benefit alumni.  ü Calls for scholarships and projects financing made by organisms of international cooperation for development.  ü The offer of online formal and informal education.  ü The offer of training solutions designed based on the needs of enterprises and businesses.  ü The offer of consultancy applied to the specific needs of enterprises.   Likewise, the corporation resolves to permanently carry out promotion campaigns oriented to fundraising that contribute to the achievement of the mission of the Foundation.    4. Market and Clients  The market in which the corporation is looking for positioning is that one of non-profit organizations, characterized by:   ü Its purpose is not to get a profit but to generate a social benefit.   ü If there were any profit, it cannot be distributed; it must be dedicated to the achievement of the objectives of the entity.  ü The origin of resources is very diverse, with predominance of contributions and donations from enterprises, business and public in general, and to a lesser extent from the provision of services.   ü The economic activities developed are fundamentally carried out in the services sector.  ü They have difficulties to measure their performances because they lack a final indicator as business outcome.   In the State of Florida this market is formed by approximately 630 private nonprofit organizations, most of which are located in the following counties: Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach. The majority of these organizations are dedicated to fundraising for causes related to health, religion, veterans’ well-being, animals’ well-being, among others. There weren’t found non-profit foundational organizations dedicated to the fundraising specifically oriented to support the expansion of opportunities for each person interested to access higher education, and the development of capacities in higher education systems; these are sustainable development objectives of the United Nations Organization, to which the Foundation is completely aligned.     The target public of the corporation is fundamentally formed by UCAB’s alumni, entrepreneurs, collaborators and, in general, with every person who identifies with the cause of promoting Access to higher education.

7	 We have found that the cities with the biggest gathering of the target public are in Dade (Doral) and Broward (Weston) counties.   The target public is divided in two main groups:   ü Alumni and collaborators established in south Florida for 10 or 20 years. The age group is between 45 and 65 years old, most of them owners of small and medium enterprises, and with a stable economic situation.   ü Alumni and collaborators established in south Florida for 1 or 9 years. The age group is between 25 and 35 years old, most of them employed as qualified personnel and with a relatively stable economic situation although depending on job stability.     For each segment of the target public, different promotion strategies are considered. In the first case, the idea is to obtain interest in the training and consultancy products that the corporation can offer to them, emphasizing the price/value relation of these products.   In the second case, the idea is to direct their attention towards the benefits that the Foundation can offer to them: information about cooperation agreements signed with foreign universities that benefit them, calls for scholarships and projects financing made by organisms of international cooperation for development, offer of online formal and informal education, among other information of interest.    A third type of promotion strategy is oriented to awaken in both groups the identification with the cause of young people educated in knowledge and values, and qualified to generate development and progress anywhere they are.

12	 5.7 Marketing Strategy  To achieve the positioning desired, 95% of the marketing strategy will be developed, executed and evaluated online, due to the fact that offline strategies like POP (among others) can result inefficient in terms of cost and value.  Advertising campaigns will be directed to raise awareness in the target public, and to achieve direct engagement with the cause of increasing the possibilities to access higher education and improving the capacities of the education systems in the Americas, always remembering the magnificent opportunity they had to obtain a degree and to develop technical competences, global abilities, and training in civic values. Messages pretend to establish a direct relation between this opportunity and the benefits produced by being competent professionals, while asking for they effective solidarity so that other young people have the same opportunity.    These online campaigns will be spread through social networks, using the three more popular platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook), and the web page of the Foundation. The content is programmed in a weekly grid that guarantees the continuity and frequency of the publications. A visual piece accompanies every publication to generate attraction and interaction with the user, so that an important base of followers is created. The objective of each social network is:   ü Twitter: To increase the followers and interaction rate in 10% monthly.  ü Instagram: To increase the followers and impression rate in 10% monthly. ü Facebook: To increase the scope and followers rate in 10% monthly.  It is estimated that this increase in the interaction generates an exponential growth monthly, and a raise in the followers’ rate equivalent to 10 new followers monthly.    Besides the online advertising campaigns, ABCU Foundation has planned, at least, one yearly event to gather alumni in which it is possible to do donations in situ. The call for these events will be done through newsletters to email lists of alumni and friends, social networks, advertising, and clipping.    6.
