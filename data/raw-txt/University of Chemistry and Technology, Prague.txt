Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
6  Home  
In accordance with Act No. 111/1998 Coll., on Higher Education and on Amendments and 
Supplements to Other Acts (hereinafter referred to as the "Higher Education Act"), the University of 
Chemical Technology in Prague  (hereinafter referred to as the "UCT Pra gue") submits the strategic 
document Strategic Plan  of Educational and Scientific and Research, Development and Innovation, 
Artistic or Other Creative Activities of the University of Chemical Technology in Prague for the period 
from 2021 (hereinafter referr ed to as "SI2021+").  
SI 2021+ builds on the previous five -year period 2016 -2020, during which UCT Prague implemented 
activities within the framework of 8 priority objectives formulated in the Long -term plan of UCT 
Prague for the period 2016 -2020 in order t o fulfil its vision to strengthen its position as a top 
educational and research institution in both basic and applied research with significant social impact 
within the Czech Republic and the entire Central European region.  
The process of creating, approv ing and publishing the Strategic Plan  of UCT Prague and its annual 
implementation plans is governed by the valid internal directive A/S/961/11/2018.  
For SI2021+, the starting document is the Ministry's Strategic Plan  for Higher Education for the period 
from 2021 (hereinafter referred to as "MoE SI2021+") and the complementary document Strategy for 
the Internationalisation of Higher Education for the period from 2021 (hereinafter referred to as "MoE 
IS2021+"). The SI2021+ is structured into 6 main priority o bjectives. The other 5 priority objectives are 
focused on the internationalization of the activities of UCT Prague. On the basis of the formulated 
vision and mission of UCT Prague, a SWOT analysis was performed at the level of individual 
operational object ives. In planning measures (in the form of activities and projects) to achieve the 
operational objectives, the expected measures at the level of Higher Education Institutes from the 
Ministry's Strategic Plan  were taken into account. At the level of measure s, the timeframe, the 
necessary resources (material, financial, human) and the responsibility for their implementation are 
defined. For the subsequent evaluation of the contribution of the implemented measures to the 
quality of the activities of UCT Prague , target values of performance indicators at the level of 
operational objectives are proposed. The measures, the implementation of which is planned to be 
financed by the state budget from the contribution from the Strategic Management of Universities 
Suppo rt Programme for the years 2022 - 2025 (hereinafter referred to as "SMSP"), are marked.  
By implementing the SI2021+ measures, UCT Prague aims to fulfil its long -term vision and mission 
over the next 5 to 10 years.  
An integral annex to the SI2021+ is the P lan of Investment Activities of UCT Prague for the years 2021 
- 2030, the outline of which is set by the Ministry of Education.  
The second annex of the SI2021+ is the Allocation of the SMSP funds for individual priority objectives.  
Vision of UCT Prague - starting points and conditions for fulfilment  
At UCT Prague we carry out excellent science and research with social relevance and significant 
application potential not only on a regional and national, but also on a global scale. We educate/train 
highly soug ht-after professionals for the workplace, especially in the chemical -technological fields 
(chemical, technological, engineering, materials, biochemical, biotechnological, pharmaceutical, food, 
environmental and economic)  for employers both at home and abroad, from industrial companies 
through the scientific research sector to public and state institutions.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
7  UCT Prague bases its current high quality and reputation on a long tradition of teaching technical 
chemistry and food  science in the Czech Republic and throughout Central Europe. UCT Prague 
therefore profiles itself as a distinctly supra -regional research technical university with high -quality 
basic and applied research in a wide range of fields closely related to the ar eas of education 
implemented at UCT Prague.  
The vision of UCT Prague  is to strengthen its position as a leading educational and research 
institution in both basic and applied research with a significant social impact in the Czech Republic 
and the entire C entral European region. We want to be a technical university of the 21st century, i.e. 
open to external and internal stimuli, fair in internal and external relations, involved in international 
cooperation and at the same time globally competitive, includin g the ability to reflect the challenges 
of sustainable development. We build on our traditions, but at the same time we want to co -
determine the development of new disciplines that will lead to civilizational, especially technical 
progress, increasing the quality of human life in sustainable natural conditions. We will be open to 
societal demand for education, knowledge and technical and technological solutions. The aim is to 
build the unique brand of UCT Prague as a relatively small, innovative and quality -oriented technical 
university, reflecting European higher education and research standards as a necessary condition for 
strengthening its already excellent international reputation.  
In higher education, we will develop top professional quality, especiall y in master's and doctoral 
degree programmes, which are highly attractive to applicants both from other Czech and foreign 
universities. UCT Prague will focus on the development of unique engineering, technological, 
biochemical, materials, pharmaceutical an d economic fields of strategic importance for the Czech 
Republic in the context of global sustainable development. As a priority, we will expand cooperation 
with industrial partners in regions with traditional and emerging chemical, pharmaceutical, 
cosmeti c, food, nanotechnology or environmentally focused industries.  
A prerequisite for achieving this vision is significant investment not only in the renewal, but also in 
the expansion and development of quality educational and research infrastructure, includi ng the 
improvement of spatial conditions, but above all in the area of human resources. Significant 
attention will be paid to both the youngest researchers, i.e. PhD students from the ranks of our own 
talented students and motivated graduates of other univ ersities, as well as academic and research 
staff with experience preferably from abroad or in natural science and engineering research spheres. 
We will focus special support on the establishment of new research groups in promising areas, on 
cooperation wit h top experts, especially from foreign universities and research institutes, and from 
domestic and foreign industry.  
A prerequisite for meeting our goals is the development of effective university management and 
support/service departments, across the whole university. To increase the success rate in grant 
competitions and improve the monitoring of projects, we will build a project centre. To make the 
school more attractive in terms of friendliness to job applicants from abroad, we will create a 
"welcom e" centre. We will provide full support to the faculties, both at the level of central laboratories 
and other supporting departments, with quality staffing and material support. We will use 
information technology as well as methodological, managerial and c ommunication tools inspired by 
European partner universities (e.g. KU Leuven, TU Delft, University of Tromsø, UNI Regensburg, ETH 
Zurich) to manage the university.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
8  Mission and Values  
The mission of UCT Prague is to train high quality university -educated pr ofessionals for industrial 
practice, public and state administration, as well as top research and scientific staff contributing to 
the increase of the country's competitiveness and the development of an economy based on 
knowledge and innovation.  
This educ ation is and will continue to be based both on widely developed research activity from basic 
scientific knowledge through applied research to innovative industrial solutions, and on close 
cooperation with industry and society in general, both domestic and foreign (especially European).  
An integral part of the mission of UCT Prague is also the active promotion and popularization of 
technical and natural science disciplines including their latest trends in the public with a direct 
impact on the sustainable d evelopment of society, the future of the young generation and the spread 
of civilizational and ethical values, especially democracy, openness, tolerance, respect, personal 
responsibility as well as education and culture in our society.  
UCT Prague subscrib es to the values of equal opportunities and fairness. We support the diversity of 
students and staff, their enthusiasm and creative motivation, while being aware of their personal 
responsibility and ethical behaviour, in all three closely interconnected co re areas of the school - 
education, research, development and innovation, and in the direct social and professional activities 
of the university, the so -called "third role".  
A necessary condition for fulfilling the school's mission is the synergy of top -quality education and 
high -quality basic and applied research with an awareness of social responsibility. The fulfilment of 
this mission brings an excellent international reputation in education, science, research and a widely 
accepted social role.  
All the  activities of UCT Prague are directed towards the goal of profiling itself as a research technical 
university in the European area, which co -determines new developmental educational and research 
trends.  
  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+

 Develop competencies directly relevant to life 
and  practice in the 21st century  
Operational objective:  Support for the development of staff competences 
for teaching and curriculum development (MoE 
SI2021+: 1A)  
For the development of pedagogical competences of academic staff, UCT Prague uses the support 
of its own experts from the Institute of Teaching and Humanities. Courses to support the pedagogical 
skills of doctoral students and academic staff sponsored by the Institute of Teaching and Humanities 
were previously financially supported by the institutional programme. The supp ort was mainly used 
by young academics and PhD students at the beginning of their teaching career. However, there is 
still no systematic training of teaching staff at various stages of their careers at UCT Prague with a link 
to the evaluation and professio nal development of academic staff. Using the synergistic effect of 
cooperation with other universities, UCT Prague will focus on systematising the development of 
pedagogical competences of academic staff and PhD students, as well as on deepening their 
lang uage skills to ensure quality teaching in both Czech and English. Linking the achieved level of 
pedagogical competencies to the career development and evaluation system of academic staff will 
strengthen their motivation to improve the quality of their teac hing activities, including the use of 
new effective educational procedures, and will contribute to the stable quality and relevance of 
teaching in accredited study programmes and LLE courses at UCT Prague.  
S: • Sufficient potential of didactics experts from the Institute of Teaching and Humanities.  
• Practical experience from didactic courses for PhD students.  
• Sharing information about the quality of teaching through discussion forums and social 
networks (Yammer, Facebook)  
W: • Systematic training of teaching staff is not implemented.  
• Limited funding for course provision.  
• Limited financial resources for the application of new educational practices.  
• The development of pedagogical competences is not linked to the evaluation of academic 
staff.  
O: • Strengthening cooperation between universities in the field of didactics of teaching 
technical and natural sciences.  
• Improving the pedagogical competencies of academic staff will contribute to improving 
the quality of teaching.  
• The quality of pedagogical c ompetencies will become part of the evaluation of academic 
staff.  
T: • Academic staff cannot be sufficiently motivated to take an active approach to developing 
pedagogical competencies.  
• The departure of some quality employees from UCT Prague due to a negati ve feeling of 
permanent overburden and disproportionately increasing demands for self -education.  
Guarantor of the operational objective: vice -rector for pedagogy  
Measure:  Development of pedagogical and other competencies for teaching and 
curriculum development (O_01)  
• Training courses for academics:  To support initial and continuing education of teachers, with a 
focus on the use of interactive and innovative educational methods to implement training courses 
for PhD students and academic staff. The aim  of the courses is the development of didactic 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
10  competencies, acquisition, strengthening and development of practical pedagogical skills of the 
participants, which they then apply in their own teaching, in the adaptation of study subjects or 
in their work w ith diverse groups of learners. The target group of the courses will be PhD students 
and academic staff of all faculties and departments across the whole of UCT Prague who are 
involved in teaching in study programmes or LLE courses.  
It is provided by: Ins titute of Teaching and Humanities.  
• Coaching and mentoring : Especially in the area of support for beginning teachers, including PhD 
students, UCT Prague plans to use the methods of coaching and mentoring in addition to classical 
training courses for the dev elopment of pedagogical competencies and their subsequent 
application in teaching. This can be done either with experienced colleagues from UCT Prague or 
in the form of field placements at partner institutions both domestic and abroad. The target group 
of the activity will be teachers of all faculties and departments across the whole of UCT Prague.  
It is provided by: The Pedagogical Department, The International Relations Department  
• Developing language skills : In order to ensure the teaching of foreign stu dents and to broaden the 
possibilities of gaining and sharing experience in the field of educational activities not only within 
domestic but also within foreign institutions, both long -term semester and short -term intensive 
language courses for academic an d scientific staff and other employees of the university will 
continue to be supported, including specialized language courses for PhD students focused on 
professional and academic English. The language courses significantly contribute to the targeted 
inte rnationalisation of the university environment, i.e. in particular to strengthening the teaching 
of study subjects in English, to more intensive involvement of staff in international scientific and 
pedagogical projects and also to improving the quality of support for service departments 
providing care for foreign members of the academic community. The target group of the courses 
will be PhD students, academic, scientific and other staff of faculties and other departments of 
UCT Prague; synergy with the oper ational objective "Support of language and intercultural training 
of university students and staff" (PC I1) .  
Provided by: The Department of Languages.  
Funding sources: IP/SMSP, own sources.  
Measure:  Motivation of academic staff to develop pedagogical competencies (O_02)  
• Evaluation of the quality of educational activities:  A systematic dialogue between students, 
teachers and supervisors of study courses/programmes will be promoted, focusing on the quality

Operational objective:  Development of methods for quality assurance of 
education and verification of learning outcomes 
(MoE SI2021+: 1B)  
For the fields of chemistry and food science education UCT Prague can accredit its own study 
programmes in ternally within the framework of the granted institutional accreditation. The College 
has set up a functional system of quality assurance of educational activities, including the 
organizational structure of the RVH, a set of internal standards for the deve lopment of study 
programmes and a regular proven student survey to obtain feedback on the quality of education 
provided by individual teachers. However, it still lacks a unified and general definition of how to 
determine the quality of education and some t eachers are reluctant to incorporate new methods 
into their teaching. UCT Prague sees opportunities for improving the quality assurance system and 
evaluation of educational activities in the greater involvement of domestic and foreign experts in 
modern tea ching methods and the process of developing study programmes, in the use of 
international cooperation in the process of developing study programmes and, last but not least, in 
the unification of requirements for both Czech and foreign language study progra mmes. The 
evaluation of the educational activities of universities and the subsequent allocation of funds for 
education predominantly according to the quantitative indicator of the number of students is 
perceived by UCT Prague as an external risk due to th e high demands placed on students studying in 
accredited study programmes at UCT Prague.  
S: • Functional organisational structure of the RVH.  
• Traditional student survey of teaching evaluation with high participation of respondents.  
• Sophisticated internal standards for curriculum development.  
W: • Difficult definition of determining the quality of different types of educational activities.  
• Scientific research activities are rated higher than educational activities by many 
academic staff.  
O: • Optimization of educational methods for study programs.  
• Involvement of experts in didactics of teaching in the development of curricula.  
• International cooperation, adapting to EU curriculum requirements.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+

Measure:  Optimization of the process of quality assurance of educational activities 
(O_04)  
• Quality assurance and development of study programmes:  A process audit and setting of 
competencies/responsibilities in the area of quality assurance and assessment will be carried out. 
It is planned to strengthen and expand th e agenda provided by the Quality Assessment 
Department in the field of education evaluation, quality monitoring, quality assurance and 
evaluation system and consultancy and support within the accreditation process. In the field of 
educational evaluation, i t is conceptual and methodological support of the agenda of creation, 
development and evaluation of study programmes at the UCT Prague and coordination of the 
process of internal evaluation of study programmes, including preparation of supporting analyses 
for study programme guarantors. In the area of monitoring, it is about monitoring the 
development of the European Higher Education Area, especially in the field of quality assurance, 
the structure of higher education studies, the ECTS credit system, qualif ication frameworks and 
learning outcomes, as well as monitoring the development of national legislation and the results 
of national projects focused on quality assurance and ensuring the transfer of information from 
these areas within UCT Prague. In the ar ea of quality assurance and development, this involves 
supporting the implementation of the "Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the 
EHEA (ESG)" covering the core activities of the University and the co -creation of quality standards 
including  monitoring their implementation. The standards of educational activities for individual 
forms of teaching at UCT Prague will be proposed.

• Opt imisation of the content and structure of study programmes:  On the basis of the evaluation of 
the outputs of the internal quality assessment of study programmes at all three levels of study 
and feedback from students / graduates / employers / representativ es of professional 
associations, the content and structure of study programmes  at UCT Prague will be continuously  
optimised. In the development of new and modifications of existing study programmes, good 
practice from domestic and foreign universities of s imilar focus, the experience of an advisory 
group of external experts from practice, international standards and modern teaching methods 
will be taken into account. The internal accreditation process will be gradually revised to optimise 
the document workf low, including deadlines and modifications to the IS to support the RVH and 
the internal accreditation process. The materials and recommendations of international 
associations such as the European Chemistry Thematic Network Association, EUR -ACE Standards 
and Guidelines for Accreditation of Engineering Programmes or the European Federation of 
Chemical Engineering Recommendations will be used to optimise and further develop the 
education system. Direct cooperation with foreign universities in optimising study  programmes 
will take place mainly within the framework of existing, but mainly planned, joint study 
programmes such as Joint Degree and Multiple Degree.

Operational objective:  Strengthening the link between studies and 
practice and preparation for future employment 
(MoE SI2021+: 1C+  
Cooperation with the application sphere has long been an integral part of the study programmes at 
UCT Prague and thanks to it our graduates achieve a high level of employment on the labour market. 
These include specialised student internships, which are a direct part of the curricula of some study 
progra mmes, the involvement of experts from practice in the teaching of subjects, the use of project -
based learning or the cooperation of partners from the application sphere on the topics of students' 
final theses. Cooperation with the application sphere at ind ividual institutes, however, is carried out 
with varying intensity. The internal methodology for the implementation of student internships no 
longer fully corresponds to the current legislative possibilities. Although the current curricula 
accredited at UC T Prague aim at fulfilling the professional knowledge and skills of graduates, they 
provide little space for the inclusion of general industry required (transferable) skills into the 
teaching. However, efforts to involve industry experts more in teaching m ay be met with a heavy 
workload or generally little interest in their involvement in teaching and curriculum development. 
The inclusion of compulsory internships in the curricula may also run the risk of companies not being 
interested in actually implement ing student internships. There is a need to clearly define the profiles 
of academic and vocational study programmes in terms of the requirement to acquire a level of 
practical skills and to harmonise legislation for universities in the area of student work  experience. 
Supporting student business ideas, which are currently of little or no interest, could also help 
students' future employment in the labour market.  
It has long been shown that if secondary school graduates who have an idea of what studying in 
technical and natural science fields entails, and who are at least partially prepared for demanding 
studies, enter UCT Prague, their study success rate and probability of successful completion is 
significantly higher. It is therefore very important to promo te chemistry and other science and 
engineering subjects in secondary (and primary) schools in a comprehensible and interesting way, 
to change the perceived fear of pupils about the difficulty of chemistry, to facilitate the transition to 
university studies  and, last but not least, to provide professional support to secondary school 
teachers who can significantly influence pupils' attitude towards chemistry. UCT Prague has been 
successfully engaged in providing support to secondary schools for a long time an d also within the 
framework of this Strategic Plan , cooperation with secondary schools will be one of the key 
components of the proposed operational objective or specific measures.  
S: • Professional practice is a traditional, functional and proven part of the curriculum.  
• Long -term experience of involving industry experts in teaching.  
• Cooperation of the university with industry application on the topics of the final thesis.  
• The existence of an incentive scholarship program for students interested in studying . 
• Long -term and successful cooperation with secondary schools in the provision of 
chemistry teaching and in the promotion of chemical, technical and natural science 
disciplines.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
14  W: • Little room for soft skills and project -based learning in accredited work experience 
placements.  
• The internal methodology of professional practices does not correspond to the current 
requirements.  
• Uneven distribution of cooperation with the application sphere across individual 
departments.  
• Student business ideas are practically non -existent.  
• Persistent negative public attitudes towards chemistry in general.  
O: • Unification of legislation for universities in the field of student work experience.  
• Clarifying the definition of the content of academically oriented and professionally 
oriented study programmes.  
• Increasing the interest of the younger generation in studying chemical, technical and 
natural sciences.  
T: • Little interest of industry experts to participate more intensively in teaching or 
preparing study programmes.  
• Businesses are not interested in student internships.  
• Those interested in higher education will prefer fields of study less intensive in terms of 
knowledge and time, rather than chemistry, biochemistry, technology or materials 
engineering.

Measure:  Incorporation of the development of general competencies required by 
practice into the curricula (O_05)  
Incorporating the development of generic competencies into the curriculum: An analysis of the need 
for and quality of teaching of transferable competencies in study programmes accredited at UCT 
Prague will be carried out. The analysis will also use the out puts of national or international surveys 
among graduates and will be compared with study plans at other technical universities in the Czech 
Republic and abroad. Through collaboration with the Alumni Club, systematic collection of 
quantitative and qualitat ive data will be carried out to assess the quality of our graduates. Based on 
cooperation with the Chemical Industry Association and Federation of the Food and Drink Industries 
of the Czech Republic, the requirements and expectations of employers will be r egularly identified 
and evaluated. Based on the outputs of the analysis, a comprehensive programme of transferable 
skills courses ending with a certificate of completion will be prepared and continuously updated 
based on the identified need for change by g raduates or employers. On the basis of the analyses and 
identified needs, courses in general competencies will be developed and included as an optional 
part of the curricula of study programmes at UCT Prague. The courses will also be offered in English.

proven coo peration with experts from the application sphere will continue in the form of expert 
lectures and workshops, new trends and information technologies will be incorporated into 
teaching, and project -based learning methods with the solution of real problems from practice 
will be used to a greater extent. A permanent goal is to maintain a high proportion of final student 
theses and projects directly linked to cooperation with companies or current scientific research 
projects. More intensive support will be giv en to the implementation of student internships and 
apprenticeships in manufacturing companies. Theoretical teaching will continue to be effectively 
combined with practical knowledge and skills from research and business practice in laboratory 
teaching. In terdisciplinarity in teaching will be promoted in existing accredited study 
programmes by offering courses in related and similar disciplines in order to increase the 
flexibility and employability of graduates on the labour market. Experts from companies t hat 
employ our graduates will be offered the opportunity to act as consultants in the preparation of 
the content of new study programmes, which should best reflect the requirements of practice, 
regional and national social needs and trends, and the future employability of UCT Prague 
graduates.

Greater cooperation between UCT Prague and HVSs in the development of vocational education is 
significantly limited by the existence of a very limited number of HVSs focused on chemistry or the 
food industry, as well as by the persistent low interest of ap plicants in vocationally focused study 
programmes. For these reasons, UCT Prague in cooperation with the HVSs has long been running 
only bachelor's degree programmes focused on restoration. The transformation of professionally 
oriented study programmes sui table for HVSs can strengthen the reputation and supra -regional

UCT Prague has prepared an Infrastructure Renewal Master Plan representing a detailed plan for the 
construction renewal and development of all parts of the university with a view to 2030. The 
implementa tion of the individual stages of the plan depends, however, on securing sufficient 
financial resources, which are estimated at CZK 2.2 billion for the overall redevelopment and 
improvement of the Dejvice campus. In order to maintain the high quality of tea ching in the study 
programmes taught at UCT Prague, it is necessary to modernise, renew and expand teaching facilities 
and laboratories, including related equipment for educational purposes (instruments, IT equipment, 
software). UCT Prague will actively se ek available sources of funding, including the planned calls for 
the OP JAK funded by the ERDF in the programming period 2021 -2027. UCT Prague has long 
supported the activities of student associations. Student associations actively cooperate with the 
unive rsity management and significantly enrich student life at UCT Prague by organizing a number 
of educational, cultural and sporting events. However, due to the limited space capacity at UCT 
Prague, they have been lacking suitable facilities for a long time.

 Improve the availability and relevance of 
flexible forms of education  
Operational objective:  Increasing the use of distance learning methods in 
full-time study programmes (MoE SI2021+: 2A)  
The use of distance learning methods in full -time study programmes has so far been limited by 
legislation and partly also by the willingness of teachers. The longer -term restriction/impossibility of 
face -to-face teaching in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic meant a forced transition to distance 
learning and massive use of online tools by both teachers and students. Thanks to the establishment 
of a support team at UCT Prague for the use of distance learning elements, a number of e -learning 
courses at all levels of s tudy (Moodle system) and the cooperation of student associations, the 
transition to distance education was managed, despite the initial distrust of some teachers to change 
the existing methods of frontal teaching and insufficient technical equipment for th e provision of 
distance education on the part of the university. Changing the National Accreditation Authority (NAU) 
standards to incorporate distance learning elements into full -time education would provide 
universities with a legislative framework and en able them to set new standards for teaching quality. 
UCT Prague must also provide sufficient financial resources for technical staff support when using 
distance learning methods.  
S: • The existence of a support team providing elements of distance education ( within the 
Institute of Teaching and Social Sciences).  
• Very good feedback from students.  
W: • Insufficient technical equipment for distance learning.  
• Teachers' reticence to change existing teaching methods resulting from insufficient 
methodological support for distance education.  
O: • Changing NAU standards to incorporate distance learning elements into full -time 
education.  
• Increased digitalization of teaching, introduction of progressive elements of virtual 
reality into teaching.  
T: • Lack of funding for regular technical support for modern forms of teaching.  
• Excessive online and virtual learning at the expense of hands -on practical laboratory 
learning will negatively affect students' manual dexterity and skills.

• Internal support for blended learning: Innovative pedagogical projects of students and academic 
staff focused on the implementation of blended learning elements into teaching and for the 
introduction of other innovations of existing study programmes or subjects (various forms of 
distance learni ng, workshops, project -based learning, creation and innovation of study aids, 
preparation of multimedia study materials for students, academic staff and pupils and teachers 
of primary and secondary schools with an emphasis on the support of the combined fo rm of 
study) will be supported. The intention is to support a smaller number of financially larger projects 
whose results will be usable by a larger number of students. Development projects aimed at 
creating and innovating LLE courses will also be supporte d. The internal grant competition of UCT 
Prague will be used to support the projects to the maximum extent possible. In cooperation with 
other public universities and using good practice from abroad, methodological materials will be

Operational objective:  Development of the range and innovation of 
methods of flexible forms of education, including 
online learning (MoE SI2021+: 2B)  
UCT Prague traditionally organizes summer schools for secondary school chemistry teachers (see 
operational objective "Strengthening the link between studies and practice and preparation for future 
employment", PC 1 ), but also international summer schools t hanks to the good reputation of experts 
at UCT Prague. CTU and U3A courses are offered as part of further education. However, UCT Prague 
does not have sufficient spatial capacity to organize these forms of full -time education on a larger 
scale, their prepa ration is time -consuming and is also underestimated in terms of staff evaluation. 
Expanding the range and forms of quality summer schools or LLE courses, including their online 
forms, can significantly strengthen the reputation of UCT Prague. In order to s hare educational 
materials in an open way, steps must be taken to properly handle copyright law (maintaining 
academic integrity) and to eliminate the risk of misuse of these materials for commercial purposes.  
S: • The existence of experts in flexible forms of education within the institution.  
• Long -term experience in organizing e -learning, summer schools and courses.  
W: • Limited space capacity of the school for holding full -time courses and summer schools.  
• The financial remuneration of staff does not ta ke into account the time required to 
prepare the courses.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
23  O: • Strengthening the reputation of UCT Prague as a leader in progressive forms of chemistry 
education.  
• Address copyright issues with regard to open access for educational materials

summer schools and the production of popularisation and teaching videos based on an analysis 
of the needs of the target group of those interested in further education, including U3A. Different 
forms of education will be used to organise courses and professional summer schools - from full -
time, combined, to distance learning. A unified form of certificates awarded to graduates of 
lifelong and continuing education courses offered at UCT Prague will be set up to contain all 
relev ant information and have sufficient telling value for graduates and their employers, etc., 
including a bilingual version of the certificates for their use outside the Czech Republic. As part of 
the expansion of the offer of LLE courses, an analysis of the possibilities of offering retraining 
courses for the public will be carried out, especially in cooperation with the branches of the 
Labour Office in the localities of its operation, and if relevant, the focus will be on the preparation 
of these courses.

Within the framework of the institutional accreditation granted for the fields of education in 
chemistry and food science, UCT Prague is authorized to recognize the previous  secondary education 
of applicants for study in accredited study programs. However, there is still no internal methodology 
for this administrative task (there is only an internal methodology for the recognition of previous 
higher education of applicants fo r study at UCT Prague). Clear rules and setting up and simplifying 
the process of assessing previous education abroad may contribute to an increase in the number of

 Increase the efficiency and quality of doctoral 
studies  
Operational objective:  Strengthening the quality, openness and 
internationalisation of doctoral studies (MoE 
SI2021+: 3C+  
In terms of the absolute number of DSP students and their share in the total number of students, UCT 
Prague is among the best universities in the Czech Republic. A basic condition for quality doctoral 
studies in chemistry is the availability of high -quality instrumentation in research laboratories 
corresponding to the latest trends in science and research . To ensure competitiveness and to 
maintain its position as a quality research university, UCT Prague must therefore regularly invest 
considerable financial resources in the renewal and modernisation of its instrumentation. Doctoral 
studies students can us e all the research infrastructure in the preparation of their dissertations and 
in their participation in national or international research projects. Another important aspect of 
quality doctoral studies and preparation for future employment is gaining int ernational research 
experience. Students of UCT Prague in accredited doctoral study programmes, including double 
degree programmes, are offered opportunities for international mobility, thanks to very good 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
25  contacts with top workplaces abroad, or active inv olvement in international cooperation projects 
(Horizon 2020). Within the newly accredited study programmes, emphasis is also placed on the 
development of transferable skills of PhD students, which increase their subsequent employability 
on the labour mark et in the field of scientific research and also in industry The study obligations 
imposed on PhD students during their studies at UCT Prague are considerable and the average length 
of study usually exceeds 4 years. The low financial valuation of PhD studen ts, some of whom already 
have or are considering starting a family, is a risk of dropping out and going into the commercial 
sphere or prolonging their studies because of the need for additional financial security for their 
families while studying. The inte rest of foreign DSP students in studying at UCT Prague could be 
supported by introducing scholarship programmes and offering high -quality double degree DSPs 
prepared in cooperation with top foreign research institutes.  
S: • Excellent research laboratory faci lities commonly available to DSP students.  
• Attractive offer of dissertation topics, linking research with the application sphere.  
• Broad involvement of PhD students in high -quality domestic and international projects.  
• Very good opportunities for internation al student mobility.  
• High employability of DSP graduates on the labour market.  
W: • Higher number of study obligations compared to other universities.  
• The average length of study of DSP students exceeds 4 years.  
• Persistent low number of DSP students going on long -term internships abroad.  
O: • Making DSP studies more attractive for international students thanks to the scholarship 
programme.  
• More attractive DSP studies thanks to the expanded opportunities for international 
mobility within international p rojects and double degree study programmes.  
• Improved completion rates of full -time DSP studies if a suitable incentive system for 
students and their supervisors is put into practice.  
T: • Decreased interest in DSP studies due to the totally insufficient num ber of scholarships.  
• Better financial conditions in the corporate sector will negatively affect early 
graduation.  
• The interest in Master's degree graduates from companies is reflected in the small 
number of applicants for doctoral studies.

• Modification of the internal grant competition for  PhD students:  In order to support 
internationalisation, mobility, interdisciplinarity of research, development of professional and 
linguistic competences and skills of doctoral students at UCT Prague, an internal grant 
competition will be implemented within the IGRA@UC TP project from the OP RDE call "Improving 
the quality of internal grant schemes". In accordance with the competition principles, the 
preparation and implementation of project applications will be conducted in English. The 
evaluation of the submitted proje ct applications will be carried out by external evaluators. A 
mandatory part of the student project solution will be for the researchers to complete a research 
or educational activity abroad and support thematic training for the successful implementation 
of grant projects. The positive elements verified within the IGRA@UCTP project will be 
subsequently implemented into the existing internal grant competition at UCT Prague.

Operational objective:  Improving conditions for successful studies, 
including support for balancing studies with family 
life, and strengthening the social integration of 
doctoral students (MoE  SI2021+: 3D+  
Successful doctoral studies are not only based on excellent infrastructure, expertise and 
international experience, but also on creating study conditions that support the natural integration 
of DSP students into the academic community while a llowing them to balance their studies with their 
personal lives. The status of DSP students is described in detail in the CPR and in the DSP 
accreditation materials. In addition to fulfilling their study obligations, PhD students have the 
opportunity to ac tively participate in scientific research work at the institutes during their studies, in 
the solution of domestic and international projects and in teaching in undergraduate studies. This 
gives them the opportunity to learn practical skills that they can then use in their future academic 
career, but also in their personal life. Possible problems of doctoral students during their studies are 
solved at the level of institutes, faculties and possibly by the Ethics Committee. At present, students 
of DSP progra mmes lack a platform for their regular meetings with the university management where 
they could discuss current topics and problems of studying at UCT Prague. Another negative element 
affecting the capacity of doctoral studies at UCT Prague is the limited spatial possibilities of the 
Dejvice campus and the social facilities that do not meet the expectations of young budding 
scientists and researchers. To better balance their studies with family life, some parent -students of 
the DSP would appreciate the poss ibility to use the services of the Children's Crèche Zkumavka, 
which are so far provided only to the employees of UCT Prague. Last but not least, the low level of 
financial remuneration is a limiting factor for DSP students, which is often the reason for e arly 
termination of studies or prolongation of studies beyond the standard duration.  
S: • Very good theoretical and practical expertise and skills of PhD students thanks to their 
active involvement in quality international and domestic projects.  
• Opportunity to gain practical experience in leading people/teams in project 
management within a student grant competition (VIGA) or as educators within 
undergraduate teaching.  
W: • Limited spatial possibilities and insufficient social facilities at the Dejv ice campus, 
which can negatively affect motivation to work during the demanding doctoral studies.  
• Low financial evaluation of PhD students often causes complications in their personal 
lives (more difficult to start a family, more difficult to access mortga ges).  
• Lack of a suitable platform for regular meetings between PhD students and the 
university management.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
28  O: • Improved completion rates of full -time DSP studies if a suitable incentive system for 
students and their supervisors is put into practice.  
• The op portunity to enhance the management and organisational competences of PhD 
students through a comprehensive range of courses in practical skills and knowledge, 
self-development and soft skills (Module C).  
T: • The increase in attractive job offers in the cor porate sphere, which cannot compete 
with the financial provision of doctoral studies, will lead to a decrease in interest in the 
demanding DSP studies or to their early termination.

Definition of the status of doctoral students:  From 2020, work is underway to obtain the HR Award. In 
the event of winning this internationally recognised award, the measures of the Action Plan will be 
implemented, including the definition of the status of all categories of scientific researchers, 
including DSP students. In order to improve the financial situation of PhD students, their involvement 
in research projects or in teaching in the form of part -time jobs or agreements for work outside the 
employment relationship will be supported to the maximu m extent possible. After agreement of the 
faculties, the minimum requirement for the teaching performance of DSP students necessary for 
obtaining a teaching scholarship will be set and the system of remuneration of PhD students for their 
teaching work will  be revised. Based on the agreement of the faculties and the university 
management, a platform for supporting doctoral studies will also be established. The platform will 
motivate PhD students to study properly and provide their education in the area of "s oft skills" 
(subjects of module C in the DSP accreditations and development of other skills), solve problems of 
PhD students related to the entry into the new environment, possible disputes with supervisors, 
problems with the fulfilment of study and other obligations. The number of courses focused on

at UCT Prague (MoE SI2012+: 4A)  
As a research university, UCT Prague has long been combining science and research in traditional 
chemical -technological fields with the most modern world scientific trends. It has state -of-the-art 
instrumentation, including unique instruments, and high qua lity human resources for science, 
research and innovation. Researchers from UCT Prague are researchers or co -investigators of a large 
number of research grants from domestic and foreign providers or are involved in direct cooperation 
with the application a nd public spheres. The Science and Research Department, the Economics 
Department, the Personnel Department and the Foreign Department provide academic and scientific 
staff of UCT Prague with high -quality information, advisory and administrative support whe n 
applying for research grants. To further expand services for project developers, the establishment of 
a Project Centre is planned.  The Technology Transfer Department is able to provide basic services in 
the field of intellectual property protection and s etting up conditions for cooperation with the 
application sphere. Insufficient staffing of this university -wide department, especially for the 
provision of professional legal services, and a not yet sufficiently defined strategy for establishing 
spin -off, licensing and valuation of intellectual property may be one of the limiting factors in 
expanding the cooperation of UCT Prague with the industrial sphere  (including greater use of the 
potential of the Kralupy Technopark) as well as more significant appreci ation of quality research 
results with the potential for transfer to practice. UCT Prague has set up a functional system for 
recording R&D&I results, which will be further developed as a source of data for the evaluation of the 
institution according to the  2017+ Methodology and for the internal allocation of funds within the 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
30  faculties of the University. UCT Prague has subscribed to the principles of the European Charter and 
the Code for Researchers and will gradually adjust its strategy of human resources m anagement in 
science and research in accordance with these principles. In accordance with the European strategy 
for Open Science, the internal strategy of Open Science of UCT Prague will be prepared and 
implemented.  
S: • Professional know -how, long -term coop eration with the private and public spheres, a 
number of high -quality research results with the potential for transfer into practice.  
• Administrative support for Czech and foreign project developers.  
• Functional internal systems for recording R&D&I results.   
W: • Lack of staff capacity to further expand support to project investigators in terms of 
administrative, legal and commercialization of intellectual property.  
• There is no defined strategy in spin -off formation, licensing, evaluation of intellectual 
property.  
O: • Establishment of a Project Centre to ensure sufficient capacity to provide effective 
administrative support to all project workers.  
• Winning the HR Awar d and implementing the principles of Open Science will allow us to 
fully integrate into the European research area.  
• Greater interest in cooperation from the application sphere, increased transfer of 
research results into practice, better protection of inte llectual property of UCT Prague.  
• Increased financial support for Open Access publishing  
T: • The changing external environment, different rules of grant providers, constantly 
increasing demands on administration.  
• The stagnation of the public research budget and the current increase in the number of 
grant applications is leading to a decrease in the success rate of winning projects.  
• Lack of experienced project specialists on the labour market for the needs of the Project 
Centre.  
• Loss of interes t in cooperation from industrial partners.  
Operational objective guarantor: Vice -Rector for Science and Research  
Measure:  Implementation of MEP recommendations (O_28)  
• Systematic support for Open Science:  UCT Prague supports the principles of Open Science based 
on international standards, which lead to increasing the quality of research, promoting 
collaboration, communication, transparency and acceleration of the research process for more 
efficient dissemination of scientific information. Open access to scientific publications and open 
access to data are the two fundamental pillars of Open Science. Systematic support and 
implementation of international standards in the field of Open Science at UCT Prague will be 
mainly related to communication of scientific results,  publishing and management of research 
data according to FAIR principles. In the case of open data, the University's policy will follow the 
principle of "as open as possible, as closed as necessary", i.e. to make data "as open as possible 
and as limited as  necessary". Other key areas will be cooperation at local, national and 
international level in the field of Open Science, including active support and involvement in the 
European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). Emphasis will also be placed on training researche rs 
(including PhD students) in Open Science issues. It will also be important to implement the 
principles of Open Science systematically in the evaluation of academic and research staff, as part 
of the career regulations or rules for the selection of new s taff. The need to introduce a new 
generation of metrics will be linked to this.

• Intellectual property protection and technology transfer:  A long -term strategy for the functioning 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
31  of the Technology Transfer Department of UCT Prague will be developed, including support for 
the establishment of spin -off companies, support for student entrepreneurship and the 
commercialization of intellectual property arising from the university's scientific research 
activities. To set the strategy, the new pro fessional capacities of the Institute of Economics and 
Management of UCT Prague will be used - an analysis of the functioning of technology transfer at 
the University of Science and Technology Prague will be commissioned, including a comparison 
with other universities and recommendations to optimize the existing process. Furthermore, the 
experience of newly emerging spin -off projects at UCT Prague will be used, from the analysis of 
their life cycle, starting with the identification of a suitable result with  high commercial potential 
and successful setting of the conditions of operation. The process of establishing and 
implementing a specific spin -off, which has been tested and proven in practice, will help the 
Technology Transfer Department to set up functio nal system procedures for other cases of 
commercialization of intellectual property created at UCT Prague. The experience and knowledge 
of the members of the working group focused on technology transfer support at UCT Prague, 
consisting of experts from UCT  Prague (technology scouts, EIT Food HUB, Technology Transfer 
Department) and from external entities focused on technology transfer (Czechinvest, I&I, Unico, 
Kapaji, lawyers from other universities or public institutions specialized in the commercializatio n 
of intellectual property) will also be used to set an appropriate technology transfer strategy. The 
proposed strategy will be submitted for discussion in the academic community and after its 
approval by the management of the UCT Prague it will be applied  in practice.  A comprehensive 
analysis will also be carried out regarding the possibility of establishing a legally sovereign entity 
focused on technology transfer from UCT Prague, which, according to the experience of other 
universities and the Czech Acad emy of Sciences, would significantly facilitate and accelerate the 
economic and legal processes related to the commercialization of intellectual property.

• R&D&I personnel policy:  In the selection and evaluation of academic staff, consideration will be 
given to international mobility and international cooperation, or experience in its 
implementation.  To further improve internal internationalisation, English versions of internal 
doc uments in the field of human resources management will be created. For the evaluation of 
academic staff in the field of R&D&I, the "Staff Profile" will be updated regularly.

Operational objective:  Promoting excellence and societal relevance of 
research (MoE SI2021+: 4C+  
The scientific research activities of UCT Prague are focused on quality and competitive basic and 
applied research in three main pillars, which are: Health and Safety, Energy Efficiency and Materials 
and Chemical Specialities. The supported research topics correspond to the professional focus of the 
individual units of UCT Prague and fulfil the parameters of excellence (international overlap and high 
publication potential), social relevance to the needs of the national economy and society, have 
interdiscipli nary overlap offering complex solutions with real commercial potential and are fully in 
line with the strategic agenda of the Czech Republic and the EU (RIS3, European Green Deal, Country 
for the Future). Researchers receive support from central university  departments that provide them 
with information, advisory and administrative services in the areas of preparation and handling of 
research grants (including excellent research projects), international mobility, legal services, 
intellectual property protect ion and technology transfer. However, the range of support services 
provided by the central offices is limited by their inadequate staffing levels. High -quality research at 
any university depends on the ability of its management to create conditions for th e work of top 
researchers and research teams. In this respect, the lack of space and funding for the development 
of research infrastructure at UCT Prague may be perceived as a risk for attracting and retaining new 
promising researchers when in competition with other domestic and foreign research institutions.  
S: • High quality scientific and research staff, fully competitive results of basic and applied 
research.  
• A clearly defined research strategy across the entire university (3 pillars) in line with the 
strategic documents of the Czech Republic and the EU.  
• Extensive and long -term cooperation with industry and the public sector.  
• International overlap of research, large number of high quality research projects.  
W: • Still insufficient commercialisation of applied research results.  
• Lack of staff capacity to further expand and improve the quality of support services for 
researchers and students in the area of R&D&I.  
• Limited spatial conditions for further development of the Dejvice campus,  high financial 
requirements for maintaining and improving the research infrastructure in chemical, 
technical and natural sciences.  
O: • Potential to be a quality, internationally competitive research university and a 
recognised partner of top international  research institutes.  
• Increased interest in cooperation from the application sphere.  
Improvement of the system of intellectual property protection at UCT Prague, increase of 
revenues from the commercialization of research and development results.  
T: • Diffi cult financing of research directions that are not included in the strategic documents 
of the Czech Republic (RIS3).  
• Inability to retain top researchers due to the fact that UCT Prague will not be able to 
provide financial conditions comparable to its comp etitors.  
• Insufficient capacity/know -how to capture all opportunities for commercialisation of 
results in a timely manner.  
• Low volume of funding, high competition and low success rate not only in prestigious 
(ERC, MSCA, FET) but also in standard (GAČR, TAČR) grant competitions.

• Supporting the relevance of research at UCT Prague:  In accordance with the national R&D&I 
strategy, UCT Prague will actively respond to current societal challenges and need s (National RIS3 
strategy, SDGs, Country for the Future), it will support long -term cooperation with partners from 
industry, as well as state and public administration, to address research topics with high societal 
relevance, such as environmental protecti on, nuclear waste disposal, hydrogen technology, 
energy storage, waste recycling (in accordance with the European Green Deal policy), healthcare, 
protection of national cultural heritage, etc. Cooperation should lead not only to high quality 
basic and appl ied research, but also to the training of promising young scientists (postdocs). An 
example is the support for the preparation and implementation of the following collaborative 
projects with the application sphere:  
o Centre for Advanced Mechanical and Chemic al Processes in cooperation with Lafarge Cement 
in Čížkovice and ČEZ to test new environmentally friendly cement and metallurgical 
technologies.  
o The Parc Centre for Applied Pharmaceutical Research, which successfully links the research 
collaboration of UCT  Prague, the Faculty of Science of the Charles University and the Institute 
of Applied Pharmaceutical Sciences with Zentiva to accelerate the process of innovation in 
drug research and development.  
o Cooperation within the Unipetrol Group with the UniCRE res earch and education centre in the 
field of chemical safety, petrochemistry and polymers, alternative motor fuels, hydrogen 
technology and environmental protection.  
We will continue to establish and support prospective cooperation with small and medium -size d 
enterprises in Prague and other regions, while making maximum use of the potential of the 
Kralupy Technopark and the know -how of the faculties. In terms of the possibility of cooperation 
across the university, the issue of circular economy is very promis ing, where UCT Prague will 
initiate the establishment of specialized platforms and innovation clusters (chemical use of 
carbon, processing of construction and metal -bearing waste) at the national level.

• Cooperation with the commercial sphere and technology transfer:  The aim of the prepared 
strategy for strengthening technology transfer is to contribute to faster, more flexible and safer 
setting up of cooperation at UCT Prague with the commercial sphere. W ith the help of internal 
technology scouts,  partners in the application sphere will continue to besystematically  searched 
for, the emerging results of the scientific research teams at UCT Prague will be monitored and 
their application potential and the pos sibilities of successful commercial use will be assessed.  A 
fund will be established and maintained at an appropriate level to cover the costs associated with 
the protection of intellectual property. Further training of academic and scientific staff and 
students of UCT Prague in the field of commercialization of intellectual property will be 
implemented. The range of courses and seminars specializing in this issue will be expanded in 
cooperation with UCT Prague’s CCC and the Department of LLE. In the future , the Technology 
Transfer Department of UCT Prague will remain an active cooperating member of the 
organization "Transfera", the transfer office of Czech universities and colleges. Promotion of the 
services of the Technology Transfer Department and gaining  the trust of the employees and 
students of UCT will be carried out using appropriate internal communication tools in 
cooperation with the Communication Department.  A commercial company VŠCHT -Enterprise 
s.r.o. will be established, and will be fully owned b y UCT Prague, focussing on the implementation 
of one -off production activities and distribution/sales of small -tonnage products with high added 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
34  value, with the aim of supporting product market entry and marketing activities. The ideas for 
production will b e primarily come from the workplaces of UCT Prague as a result of its own 
research activities. The rapid implementation of small -scale production and commercial sale of 
products which enables a fast feedback between research/development and market needs, w ill 
be an indication for further direction of research activities and will be a source of other project 
ideas.

• Laboratories for excellent research and strengthening research infrastructure:  Excellence 
research at UCT Prague will be supported by the construction of laboratories and necessary 
facilities that will be available to researchers receiving grants for excellent research (e.g. ERC, EIC, 
EXPRO, H2020, etc.) from among th e employees of UCT Prague and top scientists coming from 
the external environment.  
• Efficient use and sharing of instrumentation: Gradually, the instrumentation and technological 
equipment for science and research will be modernized in all units of the univ ersity, with the aim 
of further strengthening the competitiveness and excellence in the areas of basic and applied 
research carried out at UCT Prague. In particular, support will be provided for the purchase of 
instrumentation that can be shared and used e ffectively between the individual parts of the 
university, e.g. within the Central Laboratories, which should not only provide quality services of 
a research nature, but should also become a centre of innovation and development in selected 
areas of chemica l analysis and evaluation of materials.

Operational objective:  Development of international cooperation in the 
field of R&D&I (MoE SI2021+: 4D+  
UCT Prague has long been expanding its international cooperation in science and research 
with  European  and non -European institutions. A strong point is the relatively high involvement of 
leading scientists of UCT Prague in international scientific projects compared to other research 
institutions. Young researchers at UCT Prague are also motivated to partic ipate in international 
mobility, establish new partnerships and join prestigious international consortium projects. Internal 
initiation grants are announced to attract new high quality researchers with previous international 
experience. Despite the increas ing organizational, administrative and financial support from UCT 
Prague, significant differences persist between the individual departments, especially in openness 
and approach to sending/receiving scientists to/from abroad, which is related to the relati vely high 
workload of academic staff within the framework of routine activities and sometimes with differing 
levels of language proficiency. In the selection of new academic staff, as well as in the evaluation of 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
35  academic staff it will be necessary to take  even more account of their foreign experience and to reflect 
it in the remuneration system so that UCT Prague can attract and retain quality employees in 
competition with other research organisations on the labour market.  
S: • Intensive involvement of scien tists and researchers in the international research area.  
• Systematic support for searching for mobility and grant opportunities.  
• Internally funded initiation grants for young scientists with international experience.  
W: • Large differences between the departments of UCT Prague in openness and approach 
to sending/receiving scientists from abroad.  
• Still insufficient language skills of some academic staff negatively affecting their 
abilities regarding international cooperation.  
O: • Experience abroad taken into account in the evaluation and selection of staff.  
• Implementation of language courses for employees of UCT Prague.

Operational objective:  Popularization of natural sciences and results of 
creative activities of UCT Prague (MoE SI2021+: 
other priority objectives II. 10  
Active promotion and popularization of technical and natural science disciplines is an integral part 
of the mission of UCT Pr ague and is one of its long -term strategic priorities. To reach the general 
public, including potential groups of future students or applicants for education, many years of 
know -how based on a comprehensible and interactive form of popularization and promo tion of 
science and the results of creative activity is used. Popularisation and promotion is targeted mainly 
at the areas of interest of UCT Prague, taking advantage of the very good existing relationships with 
relevant cooperating institutions. For furth er development and improvement of popularisation and 
promotion, new sources of funding will have to be sought, either from domestic or foreign 
development projects or from cooperation with the commercial sphere. Successful graduates of UCT 
Prague and examp les of good practice from abroad will be used to a much greater extent for 
popularization and promotion activities. Cooperation within the Association of Research Universities 
and membership in Learned Societies will also be used effectively. In order to f urther increase the 
effectiveness of the work in the field of promotion and popularization of science and research at UCT 
Prague, it is essential to acquire a professional with expertise in audiovisual production.  
S: • Long standing know -how in the field of promotion/popularization of science and 
research.  
• There are a number of functional, proven and successful popularization projects 
available.  
• UCT Prague is a respected partner in the popularization and promotion of science.  
• Promotion of science and research is a long -term strategic priority of UCT Prague.  
W: • Implementation of promotion/popularization events depends on PhD students  
• Still low effectiveness of cooperation with the corporate sector in popularization 
events.  
• Absence of a prof essional with AV expertise.  
• Little experience with the international market in the field of science popularization.  
O: • Increased funding for the popularization of engineering and science, both from public 
and private sources.  
• The opportunity to make greater use of successful graduates for the popularisation of 
science and research. Use of existing international cooperation for popularization 
events abroad too.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
37  T: • Shortage of professionals and high wage demands in professions with AV expertise.  
• Rising  costs associated with the popularisation of science in the mass media.  
• Over -saturation of the Czech market with a large number of popularization events.

Measure:  Popularisation of science with an emphasis on chemistry (O_34)  
Popularization of the results of creative activities of UCT Prague:  In accordance with the mission of 
the UCT Prague as a quality research universit y, the popularization of its own interesting and valuable 
results of creative activities will be implemented in a comprehensible and clear form for the general 
public, with partial emphasis on the target group of primary and secondary school students as 
potential applicants for study at UCT Prague:  
• Existing successful popularization projects will be implemented and innovated (Night of 
Scientists, The World (is) Chemistry Photo Contest, ChemQuest, Youth Academy, Science Festival, 
etc.). At the same time, new possibilities and forms of addressing the p ublic will be sought - in 
cooperation with schools, municipalities, regions, state administration, but also the corporate 
sector, the Association of the Chemical Industry, the Association of Industry and Trade, etc. The 
aim will be to implement popularizat ion activities, if possible, in a personal, physical way, as direct 
interaction with the recipient of the message is always crucial.  
• The development of popularization and communication skills of students and employees of UCT 
Prague will also be supported with a focus on the general public. UCT Prague will also participate 
in selected popularization events organized by third parties and opportunities will be sought to 
participate in targeted promotional and marketing events popularizing science and technolo gy 
also at the international (Central European or pan -European) level.  
• Consistent monitoring of results of creative activities, their processing into press releases and 
contributions to the university website and social media profiles will be carried out, with 
maximum emphasis on up -to-date forms of processing (audiovisual form). Selected topics will 
now be communicated to the public in the form of podcasts. The possibilities of  so -called 
gamification of scientific content and the use of virtual reality el ements will be examined. The 
preparation of consumer -oriented microsites has great potential. UCT Prague will want to extend 
the reach of the described activities beyond the borders of the Czech Republic by publishing 
papers in English on international pla tforms and forums.  
• UCT Prague will contribute to the promotion of science, research and higher education in the 
Czech Republic by active media appearances, participation in national and international 
conferences, organization of professional summer schools , workshops, etc. Information centres 
in the Technopark Kralupy and in the University Centres of UTC Prague - FS ČVUT - ORLEN 
Unipetrol in Litvínov, as well as websites and social networks will be used to promote the results 
of science and research and che mical and other technical and natural science disciplines in 
general for the general public.

 Capacity building for strategic management of 
higher education  
Operational objective:  Implementation of strategic priorities at UCT 
Prague (MoE  SI2021+: 5A)  
UCT Prague has long benefited from being a relatively small, primarily research -oriented technical 
university with four very close faculties focused on chemical, technological, engineering, materials, 
biochemical, biotechnological, pharmaceut ical and food disciplines. In 2020, the areas of expertise 
were expanded to include economics. It is the size and disciplinary affinity that positively translates 
into faster and easier agreement across the university and easier consensus -building on key s trategic 
priorities, and consequently easier implementation of innovations related to the strategic 
management of the institution. In order to finance measures to support strategic priorities of school -
wide importance, UCT Prague plans to use all available  financial resources, including contributions 
from the development programmes of the Ministry of Education and the ESIF funds enabling the 
financing of longer -term systemic projects in the field of educational activities, university 
management or the imple mentation of a third role. A number of strategic activities with a focus on 
meeting the priorities in accordance with the Strategic Plan  and its annual implementation plans will 
continue to be financed or co -financed by UCT Prague from its own resources, e .g. implementation 
of innovative pedagogical projects within the internal grant competition (PIGA), promotion and 
popularization of technical and natural science disciplines, support of young scientists.  
S: • The compactness of the university makes it easier  to agree/collaborate on defining and 
implementing priorities with an institutional impact.  
• The funds of the MoE for strategic development are predominantly used to support 
activities of university -wide importance.  
• Motivation of staff/students to generate innovation in teaching and support services to 
improve the quality of university activities.  
• For the strategic development of UCT Prague, it can also use the revenues from its 
complementary activities.  
W: • Due to the size of the university  there is a limited subsidy for strategic development 
from the MoE, which allows funding only for smaller projects.  
O: • The SMSP will enable long -term stable financing of strategic activities until the end of 
2025.  
• External evaluation of the SI will allow  assessment of the impact of the implemented 
measures on the quality change, an important source of information for the evaluation 
of the quality of the university’s activities.  
T: • Changes in the external environment may lead to changes in the funding req uirements 
for strategic priorities (e.g. it is not yet clear from the OP JAK what can be funded and 
from when).  
• It is not possible to reliably guarantee the acquisition of additional public resources for 
financing strategic priorities (e.g.  from OP JAK).

Evaluation of the implementation of the Strategic Plan : UCT Prague  will carry out ongoing, annual 
evaluation of the implementation of the Strategic Plan , based on the evaluation of the interim values 
of indicators set at the level of individual operational objectives. This evaluation will be part of the 
internal quality assessment of the activities at UCT Prague and will be reported as an annex to the 
Internal Quality Assessment Report or its annual Supplement. In order to ensure external evaluation 
of the implementation of the Strategic Plan  2021+, UCT Prague plans to ap proach foreign experts, 
including existing members of the International Evaluation Panel of Evaluators created for the 
evaluation of R&D&I activities according to the Methodology 2017+. This international evaluation and 
advisory panel will be suitably supp lemented by representatives of selected employers of our 
graduates, i.e. representatives of the CAS, the Association of the Chemical Industry of the Czech 
Republic, the Federation of the Food and Drink Industries of the Czech Republic and possibly other 
relevant evaluators who can professionally assess the quality of activities implemented at the public 
technical university. An interim evaluation by an external panel is tentatively planned for 2024 at the 
latest. The evaluation report will be a stimulus for  continuous improvement of the quality of activities 
at UCT Prague and preparation of the Strategic Plan  for the period from 2026. In the longer term, UCT 
Prague is considering supplementing the above mentioned (regular) evaluation by its own external 
pane l also with a lower frequency evaluation provided within the Institutional Evaluation Programme 
(IEP) under the European University Association (EUA), or by using the consulting services of the 
European Chemistry Thematic Network Association (ECTN) or "ran king" agencies (e.g. QS, THE) 
according to the analysis of benefits and costs, depending on the choice of the evaluator.

Operational objective:  Strengthening of strategic management at UCT 
Prague (MoE SI2021: 5B)  
In 2019, UCT Prague was granted institutional accreditation, which on the one hand proves that the 
university has a well -established system of quality assurance and evaluation not only in the field of 
education and scientific research, but also in supporti ng related activities, such as economics, 
human resources or project support. On the other hand, institutional accreditation is a major 
commitment to the continuous improvement of the quality of strategic management at all levels of 
university management. An important role in this will be played by the quality of information systems 
and their ability to provide appropriately structured information, and above all by the human factor 
- the ability of managers, as well as members of self -governing academic bod ies, to analyse data 
effectively, to propose realistic strategic objectives and specific measures for their implementation, 
to choose appropriate control indicators and to evaluate the impact of implemented strategies 
correctly, at appropriate intervals. T he issue of strategic management in the university environment 
has become so complex that it requires some form of systematic education or at least professional 
training. In the case of academic self -governing bodies, it will be advisable to further streng then their 
information support and improve their service facilities at UCT Prague. Important feedback is 
provided by independent external evaluation of the quality of basic activities and the level of strategic 
management, which is still very limited at UC T Prague. Therefore, one of the measures will be the 
introduction of regular external evaluation of the strategic agenda (see Operational Objective 5A 
"Implementation of strategic priorities at UCT Prague") .

Measure:  Developing internal capacity for strategic management (O_36)  
Strengthening internal capacity for strategic management:  Close cooperation will be developed 
between the Quality Assessment Department and the Strategy and Development Department in the 
continuo us evaluation of the quality of the activities of UCT Prague and in the planning of quality 
improvement measures within the annual implementation plans of the Strategic Plan . Attention will 
be paid to the preparation of quality documents for international university rankings (QS, THE) with 
the aim of maintaining and strengthening the university's position in selected world rankings, both 
general (ranking among the world's top 500 universities) and sectoral, with an emphasis on 
improvement in the field of ch emistry and chemical engineering (ranking among the top 100 
world/European universities). Training will be provided to selected senior management of the 
university and its units in the development and evaluation of strategies in higher education. Internal 
information systems providing data for quality assessment and strategic management of the 
university will be rationalised (in terms of the amount of sub -data, emphasis will be placed on data 
aggregation). On the basis of the audit of the existing informati on systems, their development in 
terms of HW, SW and personnel support will be optimized in order to increase the yield of relevant 
data for reporting and to improve the analysis of available data. The aim is to strengthen informed 
strategic management and  decision -making based on reliable internal data, compatible with 
external datasets and analyses (e.g. SciVal in R&D).

Measure:  Implementation of a responsible purchasing strategy at UCT Prague (O_37)  
Strategy for Socially Responsible Public Procurement (SRPP) : The aim of the measure is to set up 
basic rules and internal processes in the organisation that  will help UCT Prague to gradually achieve 
a state where public procurement will be carried out in a socially responsible manner, i.e. with 
maximum positive impact on society, the economy and the environment, while emphasising the 
highest possible quality of the requested performance for the spent financial resources. UCT Prague 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
41  will strive to find tools for measuring and evaluating the impact of responsible purchasing and will 
subject the adopted strategy to continuous evaluation at regular three -year inte rvals (the strategy is 
currently prepared for the period 2021 - 2023). In particular, the university intends to place a strong 
emphasis on:  
• promoting environmentally friendly and circular solutions to reduce negative environmental 
impacts,  
• respect for human rights in supply chains and the promotion of decent working conditions for 
those involved in public procurement,  
• support for small and medium sized enterprises participating in public procurement,  
• support for people who are long -term disadvantaged on  the labour market through their 
employment in public procurement,  
• creating demand for fairtrade products,  
• creating demand for innovative solutions.  
For this purpose, the internal regulations will be modified, and methodological guidelines and 
training for  the employees of UCT Prague will be prepared. The SSOVZ Strategy is fully in line with the 
Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development of the Czech Republic, Resolution of the 
Government of the Czech Republic No. 75 (25.  01. 2017) and No. 531 (24.  07. 134/2016 Coll., on public

Measure:  Development of internal mechanisms for the distribution of funds and 
remuneration of academic staff (O_38)  
Allocation of funds and remuneration: New options will be sought  to adjust the current system of 
resource allocation to the school components, taking into account the new priorities within the 
Strategic Plan  2021+ and the recommendations proposed by  the international evaluation and 
advisory panel, or other external reviews and analyses. If necessary, the parameters of the calculation 
algorithm will be adjusted using internal and comparative external data. The adjustments will 
concern only the system of division of financial resources at the school level, within the individual 
faculties of UCT Prague an independent division of resources will be maintained reflecting their 
differences and specific missions. The mechanism of resource allocation within th e institution and 
its constituent parts will be transparently communicated to the academic community. At the level of 
the internal information systems of the university, relevant data and information support for senior 
staff will be provided, with the poss ibility of individual creation of exported reports (IS MIS). Senior 
staff will be offered the opportunity for external professional training aimed at improving 
management performance and rational strategic decision -making. In order to improve the 
stabiliza tion of human resources, UCT Prague will strive to strengthen the components of salaries 
while maintaining the motivational role of variable salary components based on transparent criteria 
for evaluating employee performance.

Measure:  Support for academic self -governing bodies (O_39)  
• Support for Academic Senates:  UCT Prague will support the activities of the un iversity -wide and 
faculty academic senates by improving the spatial facilities of these self -governing bodies, 
including providing facilities for student representatives in the senates (office space, meeting 
room) at the Dejvice Campus. The technical and s oftware support for in person, online and hybrid 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
42  meetings of the Academic Senates will continue to be developed. Especially with regard to various 
crisis situations (e.g. the COVID -19 pandemic), which make it impossible to hold meetings in 
person, the dist ance electronic method of holding elections to the Academic Senates, which has 
a long tradition at UCT Prague, will be supported. The aim will be that all the accompanying 
processes, such as nominations, candidate proposals and their communication with the  electoral 
commissions, will be carried out within one electronic system. Communication between both 
faculty and university -wide academic senates and the members of the Council of Universities will 
also be strengthened, both by setting up a system for the easy operational sharing of documents, 
experience and information, as well as through off -site meetings and regular on -line meetings 
(videoconferences). An effort will be made to motivate the academic community to take a greater 
interest in membership and active work in academic senates by, for example, paying an 
appropriate financial reward for the function performed. This form of incentive support will be 
subjected to a broad discussion in the academic community, on the basis of which transparent 
rules wi ll be established and adopted so that the system and amount of remuneration of 
members and officers of academic senates will be independent of the current leadership of the 
university and its faculties.

• Support from the Board of Trustees:  An electronic information platform will be created to easily 
and clearly provide relevant information to the members of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of UCT 
Prague about the activities and activities of the school important for their informed decision -
making. This information platform will ensure the sharing of relevant documents with other 
bodies of UCT Prague (AS, VR, KR). Technical and software support will be provided for distance

Measure:  Development of cooperation, coordination and common identity within 
UCT Prague (O_40)  
Internal cooperation, coordination and identity support with UCT Prague:  Regular meetings of the 
staff of the Rector's Office and faculty deaneries will support the devel opment of cooperation and 
the sharing of information and examples of good practice. At the level of heads of departments of the 
Rector's Office and secretaries of faculties, current topics crucial for the development of the university 
as a whole will be di scussed, taking into account the specific needs of faculties, and effective ways 
for their implementation will also be sought. Potential ideas and suggestions for improving the 
organisation of work and management methods arising from these meetings will be  used as a source 
of valuable input for strategic decision -making by the senior management of the university. It has 
become a tradition for the Rector to hold regular annual meetings with the academic community, at 
which the results of the most recent peri od and priority tasks for the following year in individual areas 
of the activities of UCT Prague are presented. Existing and new communication channels, both in 
Czech and English, will be developed for effective internal communication within UCT Prague, fo r 
sharing a wide range of information and obtaining regular feedback on the functioning of the 
university. These communication channels will be further used for sharing good practices of 
individual departments, for strengthening the common identity and bra nd of UCT Prague and also 
for external communication. The activities of the Alumni Club will be supported organizationally and 
financially as an important organization for obtaining feedback from alumni and for increasing the 
visibility and social prestige  of UCT Prague.

Operational objective:  Strengthening of strategic human resources 
management at UCT Prague (MoE SI2021+: 5D+  
Human resources management at UCT Prague is centrally provided by the Rector's Office in terms of 
organisation, administration and methodology. The evaluation and remuneration of faculty staff is 
fully within the competence of the faculties. UCT Prague already offers its employees a number of 
benefits, both monetary and non -monetary (flexible working hours, working from home, meal 
allowance, pension contribution, incentive bank programme, support services of the Zk umavka 
Children's Crèche, educational courses, foreign mobility, relaxation exercises, accommodation in 
recreational facilities, own GP's surgery). The further development of the benefits system should 
therefore take more account of the needs of combining personal life and professional career and 
motivational incentives for the career growth of employees. Although the system of evaluation of 
academic staff at faculties respects the specifics of faculties, these are not always sufficiently 
formalised and des cribed in a systematic way. The created MIS application "Employee Profile", which 
aggregates the information needed for the evaluation of academic staff, does not yet provide fully -
fledged data support from internal information systems. As at most other un iversities, the 
composition of the salary, with a low proportion of tariff components and a high proportion of non -
tax motivation variable components, does not allow to fulfil the stabilising function especially for 
young academic staff starting out (post -docs), therefore it is necessary to ensure a gradual 
restructuring of the salary. UCT Prague is generally seeking to transform its internal processes and 
policies of human resources management in order to strengthen its position as an attractive 
employer f or high -quality foreign researchers and teachers, so that it does not have to rely only on its 
graduates (threat of so -called inbreeding). It has therefore started the process of obtaining the 
prestigious HR Award.  
S: • Existing relatively wide range of empl oyee benefits.  
• Modern HR IS with a wide range of support functions.  
• A unified and centralised HR agenda.  
• The initiation grants from the Dagmar Procházková Fund enable the recruitment of 
high quality young researchers with foreign experience outside of UCT Prague.  
W: • Due to the multiple increase in the HR agenda in response to the requirements of grant 
providers and labour legislation in general, there is a lack of staff capacity to support 
the staff appraisal and development agenda.  
• There is no systemic link between staff appraisal and remuneration within internal 
documents and IS.  
• Inadequate centralised management of staff and student identities (IDM) in IT systems.  
• Still low level of digitisation and electronic circulation of documents.  
• The com position of the salary components is not suitable in terms of fulfilling the 
stabilisation function (tariffs are too low).  
O: • Winning the HR Award will strengthen the position of UCT Prague as an attractive 
employer for foreign scientists.  
• The expansion o f employee benefits will increase the attractiveness of employment at 
UCT Prague.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
45  T: • Further increase in the administrative burden associated with the personnel agenda 
with negative impacts on both academic staff and staff providing payroll and personnel 
agenda.  
• Quality employees will leave if they cannot be sufficiently motivated to work for the 
benefit of UCT Prague.

Measure:  Strengthening human resources capacities (O_42)  
Staff development and employee care:  Appropriate measures in the area of human resources will be 
sought and gradually implemented to attract and retain quality teachers, researchers and staff in 
administration and support servic es, e.g. measures resulting from the HR Award Action Plan or from 
negotiations with the university trade union (collective agreement). The aim is to provide a complete 
information service for all employees, i.e. easily accessible and comprehensible informa tion in the 
field of personnel development and employee care, including information in English. Based on the 
results of the surveyed employees of UCT Prague, the offer of existing employee benefits, both 
monetary and non -monetary, will be modified, includi ng the implementation of a system of 
employee training (using online tools) to support career growth or the expansion of the range of 
services for parents caring for children, which will make it easier to balance personal life and 
professional career. The system of care for the mental health of employees will also be developed in 
the form of expert consultations or thematic seminars. The quality of the staff development system 
and the care offered to staff will be continuously evaluated based on feedback fr om staff and 
benchmarking with other comparable institutions.

Measure:  Preventing academic “inbreeding” (O_43)  
Measures against inbreeding:  Based on the experience of ot her universities, the obligation to obtain 
at least a minimum of foreign professional experience (taking into account exceptions worthy of 
special consideration) for those graduates of UCT Prague who would like to continue their 
professional career at thei r alma mater can be considered an effective measure against so -called 
academic inbreeding. The proposal for this measure will first be discussed in the academic 
community and, in the event of its positive acceptance, subsequently anchored in internal 
docum ents. Recruitment procedures for selected academic and scientific staff positions will be 
advertised in a way that allows effective outreach to non -academic candidates, including those from 
abroad. Cooperation with foreign universities or scientific resear ch institutions will be used for 
targeted outreach to potential candidates for the new employee selection procedures. The academic 
community will also first discuss and then set the conditions supporting the use of creative 
sabbaticals at UCT Prague.

Suppo rt for IS staff appraisal:  A quality data and information base will be provided for regular 
evaluation of academic staff through the MIS module "Employee Profile", which will provide 
managers with relevant aggregated data for evaluating the performance of academic staff in terms 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
46  of their involvement in educational and creative activities and in terms of the activities of the so -
called third role of universities. The outputs of the "Employee Profile" module can be used to set up 
a transparent system of rewar ding employees according to their performance. Methodological 
guidelines for the staff appraisal process will be developed for both the appraisers (managers) and 
those being appraised. The aim is to minimize the administrative burden associated with the 
evaluation process and to strengthen its motivational role as a tool for career development of 
academic staff. UCT Prague will also continue the traditional recognition of the contribution of 
employees to the university in various areas of their professional  life in the form of annual Rector's 
Awards for the best teachers, scientists and technical and economic staff.

Measure:  Implementation of HRS4R pr inciples - obtaining and maintaining the HR 
Award (O_45)  
Implementation of HRS4R principles: An internal analytical and evaluation process will be completed 
in order to apply for and receive the HR Award awarded by the European Commission to research 
organ isations whose HR policy respects the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and 
the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. If UCT Prague wins this prestigious award, 
the approved Action Plan will be gradually implemented (2 years)  into internal management systems 
and revised in regular cycles (3 years). Specifically, measures can be expected to be implemented in 
the following areas:  
• Equal access to R&D&I workers from abroad: It will be necessary to ensure that all relevant 
document s in the field of human resources management are available in English. It will be 
necessary to modify the general rules of the selection procedures at UCT Prague so that they 
now include proof of experience with foreign mobility. It will also be necessary to ensure the 
possibility of using internal information systems intended for users among staff and students in 
English language versions.  
• Human resources, selection and working conditions of R&D&I staff: It will be necessary to revise 
the current internal documents and methodology for selection procedures in line with the Code 
of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (EUR -Lex-32005H0251 ), to systematically 
guarantee the balance of selection panels. The newly created Welcome Centre will greatly 
facilitate the adaptation process of new foreign employees. Mentoring and guidance services for 
new early career researchers will also need to be strengthened and developed, including in 
English language. In order to strengthen expertise and promote career growth in R&D&I, a 
system of seminars and training covering intellectual property rights and copyright protection, 
communication and management s kills will need to be designed and implemented.

professional work  
Operational objective:  Simplifying the transfer of information to public 
administration and improving the availability and 
circulation of information through the continued 
digitisation of agendas (MoE SI2021+: 6A)  
At UCT Prague, data from various areas of the university's activities are systematically collected at 
differ ent levels of the institution. Many of these data are absolutely necessary for the preparation of 
various analyses and reports related to the evaluation of the quality of individual activities of the 
university. For reporting purposes, automated superstruc tures are created that obtain the necessary 
data from various internal information systems. Unfortunately, there is a lack of sufficient capacity of 
in-house programmers and data analysts with knowledge of internal IS to create, maintain and 
develop these modules. Despite this limiting factor, further development of the internal IS 
application and automated processes for linking data from various databases and information 
systems (especially for the evaluation of R&D&I results, staff evaluation, evaluation of study 
programmes, support for accreditation, administrative and study agenda) is absolutely necessary, 
without quality data strategic management and decision -making are not possible. In the 
development of digitization and computerization of agendas rela ted to the activities of universities, 
UCT Prague benefits from the cooperation of higher education institutions in the search for common 
solutions and procedures, especially with regard to cybersecurity, a single digital gateway and the 
gradual digitizati on of all agendas related to the provision of public administration in higher 
education, all in accordance with the requirements of legislation and the needs of users.  
S: • The existence of a large number of IS enabling the collection and storage of large 
volumes of data and information.  
• The IS and data management security within the IT infrastructure of UCT Prague is 
technically and systemically well secured.  
W: • There is no possibility of operational setting of "managerial reports", there is no IS 
connection for effective data reporting for analysis and statistics.  
• There is insufficient programming capacity (focused on internal IS) to develop and 
modify software applications within existing IS, and there is a lack of a qualified data 
analyst.  
O: • Extension of existing IS with "smart" SW superstructures will enable more efficient data 
extraction and reporting.  
• Joint development of IS applications and modules across multiple universities, which 
will have a positive impact both in terms of speed of impl ementation and financial 
savings.  
T: • Further increase in administration and bureaucracy from both external and internal 
environment, which will paralyse the existing IS and require further large investments in 
strengthening the IT infrastructure.  
• The persistent shortage of programmers for the creation, maintenance and qualified 
use of internal IS superstructures as well as data analysts on the labour market will 
have a negative impact on the quality and capacity of services provided by the 
Computing Ce ntre of UCT Prague.

inadequate and unsustainable existing IS seems to be crucial for the further development of 
internal information systems at UCT Prague. F urthermore, the gradual optimization and updating 
of all internal information systems of UCT Prague (personnel, study, financial, managerial) will be 
continued and, in connection with this, the creation, implementation and qualified use of 
automated report ing and especially analytical tools and superstructures. The internal IS will be 
expanded with additional modules supporting electronic circulation of documents in HR, 
economics, study and project agenda, LLE agenda, etc. Furthermore, the internal SW appli cation 
will be developed to support accreditation and changes to the SP. Necessary steps 
(organizational and technical) will be taken to ensure cyber security at UCT Prague.

academic staff and university operations (MoE 
SI2021+: 6C+  
UCT Prague provides most of the support services centrally, at the level of rectorate departments, 
which guarantees the pr ovision of professional services, the application of uniform procedures and 
uniform reporting of data from UCT Prague to the state administration and other institutions. 
However, the analysis and evaluation/use of the collected data as a source of informat ion for 
effective decision -making and management processes or for project administration will need to be 
significantly improved. At present, depending on the type and subject focus of the project, it is 
provided separately from several Rectorate department s and Technopark Kralupy, which have their 
own different procedures of project agenda administration, which makes the work of project solvers, 
control of the project agenda from the point of view of the institution and uniform reporting of data 
for UCT Pra gue more difficult. The effectiveness of the work of the support service units must be 
continuously evaluated and improved based on feedback so that it is possible to provide 
comprehensive services to members of the academic community with a minimum admini strative 
burden. The anticipated positive effect will be to free up the capacity of academic staff to fulfil their 
pedagogical and creative mission with quality outputs, including the preparation of high -quality 
projects and thus increase the success rate in obtaining them. UCT Prague invests considerable 
financial resources in the renewal and modernisation of HW and SW equipment, also with the aim of 
simplifying the administrative process in general, e.g. by implementing SW superstructures that 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
49  enable effi cient collection and processing of data from several different information systems.  
S: • The high centralization of services of service departments, the existence of uniform 
procedures and rules for all parts of UCT Prague brings an advantage compared to 
other universities.  
W: • There is a lack of specialists in the supporting administration, their low representation 
due to their absence persists, and know -how is retained by individuals.  
• Often, the knowledge of only their own issues and processe s in individual support 
departments and administrative staff limits the comprehensive provision of services to 
the academic community.  
O: • It will improve the quality of analysis and evidence for operational and strategic 
decision -making on the running of the school with positive impacts on the workload of 
senior management staff at both faculty and university level.  
• Inspiration from good practice elsewhere, including abroad.  
• It will be possible to map, optimize, automate and digitize most of the  administrative 
processes at the university with positive effects on saving human and financial 
resources.  
• Providing comprehensive services in one place will significantly reduce the 
administrative burden on the academic community.  
T: • Further increase in administrative work related to the increase in the number of 
administrative staff at the Rectorate's workplaces.  
• The supply of administrative support will exceed the demand from the academic 
community, and maintaining a large number of  administrative staff will have a 
significant impact on the university's budget.

Creation of a Project Centre:  A centralized "Project Centre" will be newly created at the university 
level, which will significantly facilitate the work of the researchers from among the employees and 
students of UCT Prague by providing qualified administrative and information support for a wide 
range of different types of projects. In this way, the university will be able to increase the capacity of 
researchers and the number of projects. The services of the Project Centre are focused mainly on 
active assistance in preparing the budget  according to the provider's tender documentation and 
internal regulations of UTC Prague, on assistance in designing, implementing and reporting the 
project and on communication with other Rectorate departments that provide support services for

 Developing global competences of students and staff 
in higher education  
Operační cíl I:  Support for language and intercultural training of students and 
staff of higher education institutions (MoE SI2021+: I1A+  
Creating an attractive environment for studying in English and opening the university to those 
interested in studying abroad has long been one of the priority strategic goals of UCT Prague. The 
international environment also has a very positive impact on the success of graduates' careers at 
home and abroad. The basis of internationalisation is undoubtedly quality foreign language 
teaching. In the mo st recent period, we have managed to significantly increase the range of courses 
taught in English thanks to financial support from the MoE OP RDE project aimed at creating new 
study programmes accredited in English or double degree study programmes. It is  also very positive 
that the number of experts from abroad who are interested in guest lecturing at UCT Prague and who 
can make teaching in English more attractive and lively is gradually increasing. However, an obstacle 
to further expansion and improvemen t of foreign language teaching at UCT Prague, outgoing 
mobility and strengthening of the international environment is still the persistent language barrier 
regarding some students and employees. This operational objective within the framework of 
internatio nalisation is closely related to priority objectives 1 and 3 "Competences for life and practice 
in the 21st century" and "Internationalisation of doctoral studies" respectively.  
S: • A gradual increase in the number of courses regularly taught in English, ac creditation of 
double degree study programmes.  
• A large number of academic staff already speak English at a decent level.  
• Increasing the number of experts from abroad visiting UCT Prague able to participate in 
teaching in English.  
W: • Some teachers are not willing to teach in English.  
• Problematic level of English language proficiency of most administrative staff.  
• Low student interest in intercultural competence courses.  
O: • A larger number of Czech students studying in English will allow to increase the 
effectiveness of teaching foreign language subjects.  
• Teaching in English has a positive impact on increasing the qualification of Czech 
students and their finding better employment on the labour market.  
• Increasing interest from abroad in studying at UCT Pr ague as a quality research 
university fully supporting internationalisation.

Operační cíl I:  Development of international mobility of students and staff 
(MoE SI2021+: I1B+  
UCT Prague has long been an attractive location for inbound mobility of  students and staff from 
abroad, thanks to its high level both scientifically and in terms of research, very high quality 
laboratory facilities and intensive international cooperation of its departments, and of course also 
thanks to its location in the capital city of Prague. In recent years, the offer of interesting courses 
taught in English for incoming students has been expanded and the first course packages have been 
prepared for ou tgoing students, eliminating the risk of non -recognition of study obligations fulfilled 
during foreign mobility and the associated prolongation of studies. New double degree study 
programmes have also been accredited and are now offered to international st udents. The 
International Relations Department has sufficient know -how and in cooperation with the Erasmus 
Student Club is able to provide quality services to those interested and those already participating in 
mobility. The experience of recent years show s that the interest in outbound mobility at UCT Prague 
still does not reach the level usual for foreign universities, while the long -term higher values of 
inbound mobility at UCT Prague are already encountering administrative limits and capacity 
constraint s regarding the teaching schedule. Supporting international mobility of students and staff 
in terms of targeting mobility offers and using their various forms and types therefore necessarily 
requires securing sufficient financial resources from all availab le sources and eliminating the

W: • Persistent scheduling and space issues for provision of teaching.  
• Interest in student trips is still not as high as at other universities.  
• The information value of the website of UCT Prague in English is lower than in Czech

• Problems with the recognition of study abroad are negatively reflected in the 
prolongation of studies.  
• The administra tive complexity of arranging a large number of different types of mobility

• The worsening economic situation may lead to increased barriers to mobility for 
students from soci o-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  
• Further increase in administration and bureaucracy associated with the

Operační cíl I:  Development of professional competencies of UCT Prague staff 
in the field of internationalisation (MoE SI2021+: I1C)  
Most of the departments of UCT Prague are involved in various forms of international cooperation 
and thanks to active international contacts, employees have the opportunity to use various forms 
and opportunities for trips abroad to partner departments, int ernational conferences or networking 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
55  events. However, a persistent fear of a lack of foreign language skills among some employees is still 
an obstacle to the realization of trips abroad. An obstacle to longer -term mobility of staff abroad is 
their commitme nt to grant projects, which largely fund them, and last but not least the obligation to 
ensure regular teaching throughout the semester. Equally important for motivating employees is the 
provision of sufficient financial resources for their mobility.  
S: • Most of the departments of UCT Prague have intensive international cooperation with 
high -quality foreign universities and research institutions.  
• Quality services of the Rectorate's departments in providing international mobility.  
W: • Internationalization is still not perceived by many employees as an activity important for 
their professional and career growth (lack of knowledge of foreign languages, reluctance 
to travel abroad).  
• Barriers to mobility remain due to the obligations associ ated with grant projects and the 
provision of regular teaching.  
O: • The expansion and support of foreign cooperation and mobility also at those workplaces 
of UCT Prague, which have not been very active in the field of internationalization, will 
open up opp ortunities to obtain quality grants, improve publication performance and 
attract quality students to the teams.  
• If the share of components in the salary of academic staff can be significantly increased, 
there will be motivation and space for active partici pation in foreign mobility.  
• Possibility to provide online teaching even during the academic staff member's trip 
abroad.  
T: • Stagnation of institutional funding of universities - only the provision of teaching and 
research activities will be primarily addre ssed, internationalisation will not be a priority.  
• Long -term restrictions on international travel due to anti -epidemic measures associated 
with the COVID -19 pandemic.

 Internationalisation of university study programmes  
Operační cíl I:  Increasing the number and quality of study programmes offered 
in foreign languages and joint study programmes (MoE SI2021+: 
I2A)  
The institutional accreditation granted for chemistry and food science education gives UCT Prague 
great flexibility in creating new or modifying existing study programmes , including foreign language 
and double degree study programmes. The faculties have sufficient qualified and linguistically 
equipped academic staff capable of working with foreign students and internees. However, despite 
the growing trend in recent years, interest in studying in English degree programmes has been rather 
stagnant. The implementation of learning for self -payers encounters mainly space and scheduling 
problems. A major obstacle to the study of self -payers, especially from third countries, is th e 
complicated visa policy and limited financial resources for offering study scholarships. The internal 
process for simplified assessment of foreign prior learning for admission purposes will also need to 
be optimised. By innovating existing or preparing n ew double degree study programmes, it will be 
possible to achieve a higher interest in studying in English study programmes, especially among 
foreign students. Without quality teaching in English at all three levels of education, UCT Prague will 
not be abl e to compete with other research -oriented universities at home and abroad.  
S: • Study programmes in English are accredited for all three levels of study, and there is a 
relatively wide and comprehensive range of subjects taught in English.  
• Institutional accr editation allows flexibility in creating new or changing existing study 
programmes.  
• A sufficient number of highly qualified and linguistically equipped teachers supporting the 
work with foreign students and interns.  
W: • Persistent low interest of foreign self -payers and Czech students in study programmes 
taught in English.  
• The limited number of classrooms, scheduling problems, heavy workload of teachers and 
the lack of appreciation of foreign language teaching negatively affect the willingness to 
increase the number of study programmes and subjects taught in English.  
• The process of internal nostrification of previous secondary education at UCT Prague is 
not yet optimal (lack of human resources, only basic internal documentation).  
O: • Improvement of the quality of the offered study programmes taught in English and 
systematization of the offer of English courses will lead to higher interest in studying 
among foreign applicants and Czech students.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
57  • Through high -quality double degree study programmes, cooperation with foreign 
universities can be significantly deepened and expanded in the field of R&D.

58  Operační cíl I:  Inclusion of the international dimension in the structure of study 
programmes, including mobility windows (MoE SI2021+: I2B)  
The interest in outbound mobility within the study programmes accredited at UCT Prague is more or 
less stable. Thanks to the possibility of individual study plans, it is possible to study abroad without 
having to extend your studies beyond the standard stu dy period. However, the newly accredited 
study programmes do not have the so -called mobility windows consistently incorporated into their 
curricula and it will therefore be necessary, where possible, to modify the IA study programmes. The 
newly promoted ty pes and forms of mobility using a combination of online tools and physical 
mobility, the possibilities of which are the subject of a number of professional training and support 
events, seem to be an opportunity to include an international dimension in stud ies. The possibility 
of setting up an individual curriculum also provides space for the realization of foreign mobility. 
Another viable option is to support the participation in the teaching of courses in English, offered e.g. 
within accredited double degr ee study programmes, also for students in Czech study programmes. 
The risk of introducing compulsory mobility within study programmes is the potential lower interest 
of applicants in studying and the uncertainty in securing sufficient financial resources f or the 
sustainability of mobility in the future.  
S: • Interest in international mobility among students has been stable for a long time.  
• The granted IA gives sufficient room for the inclusion of an international dimension in 
the structure of accredited study  programmes (use of the so -called mobility windows).  
W: • There is not enough space in the curricula for the inclusion of "mobility windows" as part 
of the standard studies (in B and N study programmes).  
• The administration does not have sufficient capacity to ensure the international mobility 
of all students in B, N and D study programmes.  
O: • The new double degree programmes offer the possibility of teaching of subjects in 
English for students of Czech study programmes too.  
• Compulsory international  experience even within standard study programmes would 
significantly increase the quality of graduates and their competitiveness on the labour 
market.  
T: • With a bigger interest in English versions of the courses there could be complications 
with arrangin g the timetable.  
• Unless sufficient institutional funding for universities can be secured, it will not be 
possible to introduce international mobility as a compulsory part of the curriculum 
across the board.  
• The obligation of foreign mobility within the stu dy programmes offered at UCT Prague 
could negatively affect the interest of Czech applicants in studying.

International mobility as part of study plans : The obligation of some form of foreign cooperation,

 Simplifying the process of recognition of foreign education  
Operační cíl I:  Implementation of automatic recognition of education and 
study results abroad (MoE SI2021+: I3A)  
Within the framework of the institutional accreditation, UCT Prague can already internally verify the 
previous education obtai ned abroad of applicants for studies. For applicants for doctoral studies, 
this process is the responsibility of individual faculties, while for applicants for undergraduate 
studies, the process is now unified at the central rectorate level. However, the w hole process of 
recognition of previous education still needs to be optimised at UCT Prague, internal documents 
need to be set up and the necessary organisational and personnel facilities need to be created. UCT 
Prague tries to simplify the process of reco gnition of education and study results abroad by creating 
packages of courses mutually recognizable between partner universities. The automatic recognition 
of study abroad results would further facilitate the consideration of the mutual compatibility of 
subjects taught at major partner universities, already when designing new study programmes. 
Setting up uniform processes and transparent criteria for the recognition of study abroad results 
within the institution in accordance with the current legislative fr amework can strengthen the 
interest of our students in studying abroad and increase the number of self -payers from abroad.  
S: • Significant acceleration and simplification of the agenda related to the recognition of 
previous studies thanks to IA, the univers ity can provide this process itself.  
• Creating course packs simplifies the recognition of study abroad.  
W: • The inconsistent approach of teachers and faculties complicates the process of 
recognition of courses taken abroad.  
• The limited compatibility of the study programmes at UCT Prague and partner 
universities makes the recognition process more difficult.  
O: • Systematic setting and anchoring of the process of mutual recognition of education and 
study results abroad will allow to take in to account the compatibility of the study 
programme with the main foreign partner universities.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
60  • Thanks to faster and easier recognition of previous studies provided under the IA, the 
interest of foreign applicants in studying at UCT Prague may increase.  
T: • Too strict conditions of recognition of study abroad, or insistence on full compatibility of 
courses will reduce the interest of students of UCT Prague in studying abroad.  
• Any lower quality of recognised prior learning from abroad may lead to lower qual ity 
students and higher academic failure.

 Creating an international environment at universities 
and promotion abroad  
Operační cíl I:  Support for the development of international marketing of 
universities and the Czech Republic (MoE SI2021+: I4A)  
UCT Prague takes the initiative to engage in international marketing activities and actively and 
purposefully promotes and offers all types of study opportunities abroad. In cooperation with other 
public universities, it participates in the Study in Prague initiative, which provides a complete 
inform ation service to those interested in studying at a higher education institute in Prague.  
Promotion of studies at UCT Prague is carried out through participation of representatives at student 
and educational fairs in selected foreign regions/countries, dir ect visits to selected foreign 
universities and involvement in national promotional and marketing initiatives to support higher 
education in the Czech Republic and through local branches of international student organizations. 
The promotion of science and research at UCT Prague is carried out using all available 
communication channels and also by presenting the professional contributions of students and 
employees of UCT Prague at international events. Promotion of the quality of the institution as well 
as scientific research disciplines at UCT Prague is also ensured by active involvement of UCT Prague 
in international university rankings, where it maintains a good position in comparison with other 
universities in the Czech Republic and also in comparison wit h similar foreign universities.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
61  S: • UCT Prague has a good position in international rankings.  
• Studying in the Czech Republic is of the same quality, but significantly cheaper than in 
Western European destinations. Prague is an attractive place to study.  
• A generation of today's parents of potential foreign students studied chemistry and food 
science in the former Czechoslovakia, so they have a very good relationship with the 
Czech Republic.  
W: • At a national level there is a lack of effective marketing of do mestic HEIs abroad.  
• The rigid visa system severely limits the potential of the Czech Republic to be a popular 
study destination.  
• Modern marketing approaches are costly in terms of both technical and personnel 
needs.  
O: • The creation of the Welcome Centre may bring an increase in interest in studying at UCT 
Prague.  
• Expanding the university’s offer with new study programmes focused on applied 
economics may bring more students from abroad to UCT Prague.  
T: • Situations similar to the COVID -19 pandemic have a significant potential to limit or 
significantly complicate interest in studying abroad.  
• The deterioration of the security situation in the world may lead to a decline in interest 
in studying abroad.  
• The development of online study may result in a decline in interest in traditional in 
person study.

The quality of the University in terms of its ability to ensure and further develop internationalisation 
is also reflected in the informatio n and service offer, not only for existing foreign students and 
employees, but also for all potential applicants for study and employment from abroad. The main 
qualified support for international students and employees in the form of a broad information se rvice 
and administrative support has long been provided by the Foreign Department of UCT Prague, in 
cooperation with other Rectorate departments and faculty deans' offices, as well as in cooperation 
with student associations, which are local representation s of international student organizations.

Operační cíl I:  Working with foreign students and graduates (MoE SI2021+: I4C)  
Organisational and administrative support for foreign students in English study programmes is 
currently the responsibility of the International Relations Department and individual deaneries. The 
main support of the International Relations Department is focused on the application period and the 
processing of applications. After enrolment, all study matters are then the responsibility of individual 
deaneries. Furthermore, the Counselling and Career Centre is involved in supporting foreign students 
and provides services to all students of UCT Prague regardless of the language of their study 
programme. The International Relations Department cooperates with active foreign students in 
promoting the opportunities to study at UCT Prague by involving them in marketing activities and 
promoting study and opportunities at UCT Prague. The Alumni Club of UCT Prague systematically 
works and develops the area of al umni relations and participates in the working group within the 
project "Study IN" provided by the House of International Cooperation organization (HIC) with the 
aim of further development of cooperation with foreign alumni. Thanks to participation in this  
initiative, UCT Prague has the opportunity to share "best practices" with other participating Czech 
universities. In order to increase the attractiveness of UCT Prague as an institution enabling the 
smooth study of foreign students with a range of service s standard at most European and world 
universities, it will be necessary to further strengthen this area of internationalisation, both financially 
and organisationally.

 Strengthening the strategic management of 
internationalisation  
Operační cíl I:  Support for comprehensive internationalisation at institutional 
level (MoE SI2021+: I5A)  
Internationalization is interwoven across all the main and supporting activities of the university and 
is an integral part of the Strategic Plan  of UCT Prague. UCT Prague actively seeks to develop 
international cooperation at the level of faculties and individual departments and takes maximum 
advantage of the opportunities offered to improve processes leading to the development of 
internationalisa tion also at the institutional level. The internationalisation of UCT Prague will be 
regularly evaluated externally to ensure its further development and strengthening towards 
educational and scientific research activities. Promoting internationalisation i s an organic part of all 
strategic documents.  
S: • International cooperation (at least to a minimum extent) is an organic part of strategic 
documents at all levels of management.  
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
65  • The size and compactness of UCT Prague allows for effective and rational 
implementation of the necessary measures to strengthen and develop 
internationalisation.  
W: • The positive effects of internationalisation only become apparent over a longer period 
of time, which sometimes reduces the interest of academics in internationalisation.  
• Many academic staff do not have sufficient time to devote to the issue of 
internationalisation outside their current work duties.  
O: • Support for the internationalisation of higher education from the Ministry of Education 
and the EU is growing, offering the possibility of using a wide range of financial support 
instruments and expert advice.  
• There are many examples of good practice in the field of internationalisation at the 
institutional level of other universities, which can be effectively applied in the conditions 
of UCT Prague.  
T: • Unless there is a consensus among all actors within UCT Prague on the necessity of a 
comprehensive internationalisation of the entire university , this may slow down or 
jeopardise the achievement of the planned ambitious goals.

Conclusion  
The presented Strategic Plan  represents a widely discussed collective work, which was created in 
close cooperation with the top management of the University,as well as the management of all its 
faculties and Technop ark Kralupy. Heads of university -wide departments, members of academic 
senates, including student representatives, and members of the board of trustees were all sources of 
valuable input.  
The preparation of the document was carried out in the period when t he evaluation of UCT Prague 
by the International Evaluation Panel (IEP) in connection with modules 3 to 5 of Methodology 17+ for 
the evaluation of research organisations and the preparation of documents for the HR Award was 
also underway. All these three a ctivities were closely linked. The recommendations of the IEP, 
together with the anticipated recommendations of the European Commission on the 
implementation of the HR Award, will be reflected in the strategic management of UCT Prague in the 
coming period.  
The Strategic Plan  is a key document for the further development of UCT Prague. It reflects the 
priority objectives of the new Strategic Plan  of the Ministry of Education for the field of higher 
education for the period from 2021 and at the same time develops its own mission and vision based 
on long -held European civilizational values.  
The Strategic Plan  reflects the ambitious vision of Europea n universities as described in the EUA 
(European University Association) strategy document Universities without walls - A vision for 2030.  
The preparation of the Strategic Plan  was influenced in no small part by the Covid -19 pandemic. This 
pandemic has sho wn the fragility of European civilisation, but also the extraordinary social role of 
universities. We also understand the crisis events of the pandemic as an opportunity to make 
changes in favour of new quality educational activities, cutting -edge technica l research and, above 
all, the irreplaceable social role of UCT Prague in the Czech and European environment. We are 
convinced that the SWOT analyses and the proposed measures including specific indicators are the 
right way for the development of UCT Pragu e as a competitive European technical university of the 
21st century.

69  Annex 1: Plan of investment activities of the University of Science and 
Technology Prague for the years 2021 - 2030  
The starting document for planning the investment strategy of UCT Prague is the Construction 
Development Master Plan of UCT Prague (hereinafter referred to a s the Development Master Plan) 
presented in 2018. The development generation is based on a detailed passporting of the existing 
buildings used by the university and aims to optimize the use of the property of UCT Prague, to 
determine the necessary scope of  modernization, reconstruction and additions and to determine the 
necessary scope of new construction as well as the renewal of IT and instrument infrastructure in 
accordance with the development strategy of UCT Prague until 2030.  
The Development Master Pl an takes into account the requirements of individual faculties and central 
departments as well as other parts of UCT Prague (Technopark Kralupy, Administration of special 
purpose facilities) for the following activities:  
• educational,  
• scientific research, d evelopment and innovation,  
• accommodation and catering,  
• sports and leisure,  
• other activities to ensure the good reputation of the college.  
The Development Master Plan forms a binding framework for all development projects of UTC 
Prague, not only in the fiel d of construction, but also specifies and addresses the operational and 
security concept of the university.  
In accordance with the Development Master Plan, the school is planning several large -scale 
construction and investment projects for the period 2021 -2030:  
• modernisation of the Dejvice Campus (reconstruction in buildings A, B, C, extension in the 
courtyard of building B, new building on Vítězné náměstí),  
• purchase of real estate in the territory of the capital city of Prague and its reconstruction for the 
purposes of teaching and R&D activities,  
• reconstruction and modernisation of student halls of residences at the Prague 4 - Kunratice 
campus,  
• modernisati on of the student learning centre Běstvina in the Chrudim district,  
• reconstruction of the recreational facility of the UCT Prague in Jáchymov,  
• construction of an experimental research facility at Lafarge Cement, Čížkovice.  
The planned dates for the implem entation of the activities will be continuously updated in the annual 
plans for the implementation of the strategic plan, depending on the progress of the preparatory 
work and securing sources of funding for the implementation of these investment activitie s. 
In the period from 2021 to 2026, general building modifications are planned in Buildings A and B of 
the Dejvice Campus , which are primarily related to optimizing the use of space capacity for teaching 
and scientific research activities and also take into account the planned development requirements 
of individual departments of the faculties and the Rector's Office. This s tage of construction work will 
also include the construction of so -called excellent laboratories, which will be available to top 
scientists coming to UCT Prague with prestigious grant projects. The reconstructions will 
continuously implement measures in ac cordance with the new fire safety design of the buildings. In 
the years 2025 - 2026, reconstruction of the façade of Building A, modification of the attic space of 
Building B and reconstruction of the extension of Building B are planned. Reconstruction wor ks are 
also planned in other premises of Building B, which will be gradually released from long -term leases 
in the period 2023 -2030 (CTU VIC, CTU Archives, Klokner Institute, CESNET) after their moving out in 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
70  accordance with the Development Master Plan.  
In the period 2021 - 2025  preparation and implementation of an investment project of a technical  
building in the courtyard of building B  is planned.  
In 2024 - 2029  , preparatory and implementation works are planned for the  construction of a new 
office buildi ng on Vítězné náměstí in Prague 6 - Dejvice .  
As part of the gradual reconstruction of the student learning centre Běstvina  ( Chrudim district), after 
the reconstruction of the sewerage system and sanitary facilities in 2020 , it is planned to build new 
accommodation facilities (log cabins, a building for year -round accommodation), a laboratory, 
reconstruction of the canteen and kitchen, along with the playground and other landscaping. The 
aim is that the student learning centre can be used for the needs of  the academic community.  
In the years 2021 - 2030  , in addition to the acquisition of central heating regulation at the Volha and 
Sázava halls of residences, the reconstruction of the boiler room at the Volha halls of residence, the 
multifunctional sports ground in the halls of residence in Prague 4 - Kunratice and the reconstruction 
of all distribution systems in the halls of residence (electricity, water, heating duct, sewerage) are 
planned . In 2021, the land under the buildings of UCT Prague should be p urchased from the Prague 
City Council. In the period 2024 - 2028, a gradual complete reconstruction of the Volha halls of 
residence is planned. The reconstruction of the recreational and training facility of UCT Prague in 
Jáchymov is planned for 2022.  
The Kralupy Technopark  will also have to undergo some reconstruction and maintenance; the start 
of investment activities can be expected probably in 2025 , the extent of reconstruction and 
modifications will be determined by the current needs. It may be necessa ry to look for other premises 
to provide for Technopark activities, for example in connection with projects focused on the circular 
economy in the processing of metal -bearing waste or raw materials for the production of building 
materials. The first major investment in relation to the circular economy is the establishment of the 
Centre for Advanced Mechanical and Chemical Processes (CAMCP) as a detached workplace of 
Technopark Kralupy in the premises of the cement plant in Čížkovice (Lafarge Cement a.s.).  
It should be noted that the full implementation of the above -mentioned investment construction 
depends on the volume of financial resources that UCT Prague will be able to obtain within the 
framework of institutional or special -purpose financing. Reconstruc tion of the Dejvice Campus in the 
total amount of CZK 2.2 billion is included among the priority actions of the MoE in the National 
Investment Plan of the Czech Republic until 2050.  
In accordance with the planned priority objectives of SI2021+, in the peri od 2021 - 2030, 
instrumentation and technical equipment will be acquired for the material and technical support of 
teaching, scientific and research activities of the departments of UCT Prague and the operation of 
supporting departments, using all availabl e sources of funding, i.e. EU operational programmes from 
the ending programming period 2014 - 2020 (OP RDE, OP EIC, etc.) and the newly prepared period 
2021 - 2027 (OP JAK, OP TAC, etc.), other domestic and foreign grants (Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe, 
GA ČR, TAČR, etc.), institutional funding from the state budget and own resources.  
1. List of individual major investment activities planned for implementation in the period 2021 -2030

(building B), Zikova Street, Prague 6 - office part  
Brief Description:  Comprehensive reconstruction of part of Building B ( Zikova Street), which were 
long -term leased to CTU until the end of 2017, due to the completely unsatisfactory and dilapidated 
technical condition of these premises. The aim of the reconstruction is not  only to adapt them to 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
71  modern premises for the needs of UCT Prague, but also to meet the existing safety and hygiene 
regulations and standards. Reconstruction of office space (including media distribution and building 
of new IT infrastructure) will be carr ied out, newly equipped with AVT and furniture, for the needs of 
deaneries, rectorate departments and also institutes that do not implement practical laboratory 
teaching. This project will also include a general reconstruction of the sanitary facilities, 
communication areas and entrance areas to the building, including the installation of turnstiles at 
the entrances. A total of 9,600 m2 of usable area will be reconstructed, of which the net usable area is 
5,400 m2. No building permit is required for the rec onstruction of these premises.  
Estimated cost of the investment activity excluding VAT: CZK 173 million excluding VAT (CZK 2 million 
for design documentation, CZK 138 million for construction works, CZK 13 million AV equipment, CZK 
20 million for interior  equipment), of which the subsidy from the MoE amounts to CZK 147 million. 
and own resources CZK 26 million.  
Framework schedule of the investment activity:  2018 - 2021 (preparation of construction 
documentation 2018 - 2020, 09/2020 - 12/2021 construction i mplementation including AVT 
equipment and furniture).  
Justification of the activity - link to the priorities of the SI2021+:  This activity is part of the 
Development Master Plan of UCT Prague. Its implementation will enable further follow -up stages of 
the school's development (reconstruction of the vacant space after the administrative offices in other 
buildings on the Campus, building into the courtyard of Building B), operational optimization of the

III. Purchase of a suitable building and its renovation for teaching and research purposes  
Brief Description:  Purchase of a suitable property with a net usable area of 3,500 - 4,000 m2 within 
reasonable distance from the Dejvice Campus with the possi bility of internal structural renovations 
for the needs of theoretical teaching (classrooms, offices; 2,000 m2 of space) and experimental work 
(laboratories; 1,000 - 1,500 m2 of space). The property to be acquired must be in overall very good 
structural an d technical condition, with a suitable internal layout and ceiling clearance so that it does 
not require radical structural alterations. The reconstruction will therefore mainly concern HVAC, fire 
safety, social and hygienic facilities and IT network infra structure.  
Estimated cost of the investment activity excluding VAT: CZK 255 million  (purchase of real estate CZK 
205 million, building reconstruction and internal equipment CZK 50 million).  
Framework schedule of the investment activity:  2021 -2023 (purcha se of property 2021, gradual 
reconstruction 2022 - 2023).  
Justification of the activity - link to the priorities of the SI2021+: As part of its strategic development 
plan for the period 2021+, UCT Prague has agreed to strengthen and improve the quality of teaching 
and research in applied economics focused on chemistry, food science and the environment. At the 
end of June 2020, UCT Prague received accreditation for a period of 5 years for the Bachelor's and 
two follow -up Master's degree programmes with the p ossibility to start teaching as early as 
September 2020. It can be realistically assumed that by 2025 the number of students will gradually 
increase to 800 - 1000. Ensuring quality teaching of the expected number of students in the new 
economic study progr ammes will require the employment of 70 -80 teachers. Accommodating the 
above numbers of students and academic staff while meeting basic hygiene and safety (OHS, Fires 
safety) standards requires approximately 2,000 m2 of net usable area of teaching and offi ce space. 
The necessary space in the existing campus of UCT Prague in Prague 6 -Dejvice is not currently 
available and will not be available in the long term (until 2030). Long -term commercial lease (more 
than 10 years) proved to be less advantageous from a utility, technical and economic point of view 
than the purchase of a suitable property owned by UCT Prague. In addition, the building itself can be 
gradually adapted for teaching economic study programmes, and part of the premises can also be 
adapted for  experimental (laboratory) teaching. PC1 - measure for Building infrastructure for

IV. Comprehensive reconstruction of the premises vacated from the lease in building no. 1903 
(building B), Zikova Street, Prague 6 - laboratory part  
Brief Description:  Comprehensive reconstruction of parts of the building of UCT Prague No. 1903, 
Prague 6 - Dejvice, situated in the streets Zikova, Šolínova and Studentská, which were used long -
term by CTU until the end of 2017 (in the form of a lease) and are now in a com pletely unsatisfactory 
technical state of disrepair. The aim is not only to adapt them to modern premises for the needs of 
UCT Prague, but also to meet all fire -technical, safety and hygiene regulations and standards.  
The project will include a general rec onstruction and conversion of unusable and non -functional 
Strategic Plan  of the University of Technology Prague for the period 2021+  
73  office space into modern chemical laboratories designed for practical teaching of students in all 
types of study programmes (bachelor, master, doctoral), as well as for high -quality basic and applie d 
research. In total, 960 m2 of new laboratory space will be built, meeting all OHS requirements, 
equipped with efficient air conditioning, new media distribution and new IT infrastructure. The 
reconstruction of the laboratory space is synergistically conn ected with the reconstruction of the 
office space - workrooms for academic staff and students (approximately 1,270 m2). In total, this will 
create 2,230 m2 of quality space for the needs of faculty institutes, Central Laboratories and other 
university -wide  research facilities. Within the framework of the project, office space will also be 
adapted for the needs of the central rectorate workplaces (320 m2). In addition, 510 m2  of space for 
student lecture halls and rooms will be reconstructed. The project wi ll also include a general 
reconstruction of sanitary facilities (120 m2) and communication areas (1,820 m2), and a small part of 
the premises will be adapted for IT needs (15 m2). A building permit will be required for the 
reconstruction of these premises with a total usable area of 4,700 m2(or a net usable area of 2,870 
m2), as part of the premises are being changed from office to laboratory use.)  
Estimated cost of the investment activity excluding VAT: CZK 238 million without VAT (of which CZK 
188 million for construction works and project documentation, CZK 50 million for interior 
equipment).  
Framework schedule of the investment activity:  2019 -2023 (preparation of project documentation 
2019 - 2020, construction implementation 2022 - 2023).  
Justification of the activity - link to the priorities of the SI2021+:  Due to the long -term critical shortage 
of suitable premises for university teaching and s cientific research activities, in particular quality 
laboratory space and also adequate administrative facilities in the buildings owned by UCT Prague, 
the reconstruction of the vacated premises is necessary to remedy the current critical situation in 
term s of space. This action is part of the overall Development Master Plan of UCT Prague. Its 
implementation will enable further follow -up stages of the school's development (reconstruction of 
the vacated space from the administrative offices in other building s of the university campus, 
building into the courtyard of Building B), operational optimization of the buildings, expansion of 
teaching and research spaces, solving the unsatisfactory level of fire safety, increasing the level of 
occupational health and s afety and meeting current hygiene regulations, especially in laboratories 
(e.g. efficient air conditioning). The implementation of this activity will significantly improve the 
spatial, working and teaching conditions at 8 institutes and also at two school -wide workplaces of 
UCT Prague at the Dejvice Campus. Selected departments from Building A and Building B (part of 
Technická Street) will be relocated to the newly renovated premises. PC1 - measure for Building

reconstruction of the laboratory space is synergistically connected wi th the reconstruction of the 
office space - workrooms for academic staff and students (approximately 1,880 m2). In total, this will 
create 3,780 m2 of quality space for the needs of faculty institutes, Central Laboratories and other 
university -wide researc h facilities. As part of the investment project, a general reconstruction of 
sanitary facilities (350 m2) and communication areas (1,300 m2) will also be carried out. A building 
permit will be required for the reconstruction of these premises with a total usable area of 5,730 m2(or 
a net usable area of 4,130 m2), as part of the premises are being changed from office to laboratory 
use.)  
Estimated cost of the investment activity excluding VAT: CZK 400 million  
Framework schedule of the investment activity:  2025 - 2029 (2025 - 2027 preparation of project 
documentation; 2028 - 2029 actual implementation of the construction part)  
Justification of the activity - link to the priorities of the SI2021+:  Due to the long -term critical shortage 
of suitable space, especia lly quality laboratories and also adequate administrative facilities in the 
buildings owned by UCT Prague, it is important to continue the reconstruction of other, gradually 
vacated premises within the buildings of the Dejvice Campus. The implementation of  this project will 
allow to significantly improve the spatial, working and teaching conditions at all faculties of UCT
