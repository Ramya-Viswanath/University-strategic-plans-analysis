UNIVERSITY STRATEGIC PLAN 2024-30
MISSION
SECTIONSAs a land grant institution committed to teaching, research, and outreach 
and engagement, Oregon State University promotes economic, social, 
cultural and environmental progress for the people of Oregon, the nation 
and the world.
OUR FOUNDATIONAL VALUES
As we embark on this next chapter in Oregon State University’s story, we 
affirm our collective commitment to our underlying values of excellence, 
knowledge generation, environmental stewardship and equity. We will:
• Support the excellence and diversity of faculty work: traditional 
and alternative ways of knowing; basic, applied and engaged 
scholarship; transdisciplinary collaboration; and innovation  
and entrepreneurship. 
• Continually work to remove barriers and create equitable 
outcomes for communities denied access to opportunity.
• Value and integrate the diverse lived experiences, perspectives 
and viewpoints within Oregon State and the communities  
we serve.
• Broaden our distinction in collaborative, team-based and 
solutions-oriented work.
• Engage communities to build resilient relationships, advance 
shared goals and ensure sustainable futures.
A Commitment to Tribal Nations and Indigenous Communities
Oregon State University in Corvallis is in the traditional homelands 
of the Marys River or Ampinefu Band of Kalapuya. Following the 
Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855, Kalapuya people were forcibly 
removed to reservations in Western Oregon. Today, living descendants 
of these people are part of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde 
Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians.
Oregon State University recognizes the impact that its land grant 
history has had, and continues to have, on Tribal Nations and Indigenous 
communities in Oregon. Grounded in self-reflection, learning, 
reconciliation and partnership, the university will through its actions 
advance the sovereignty, rights and prosperity of Tribal Nations and 
Indigenous communities in Oregon and nationally.2

Conclusion
What this plan is — and is not
Many strategic plans aspire to capture everything an institution wants to do. This is not that kind 
of plan. 
Driven by the imperative of civic contribution, this is an intensely focused plan, offering the world an 
achievable vision: that humankind can equitably and sustainably prosper, and that Oregon State will be 
a catalyst for that prosperity. 
This is a collaborative vision that values the strengths of diverse physical and human geographies: 
urban and rural; sovereign Tribal Nations; businesses small and large; farms and ranches; ocean, coast, 
forest, mountains and desert; schools and community colleges. And it is a deeply human and hopeful 
vision — one that celebrates interconnectedness, upholds the dignity of every person and offers a way 
forward for our state, the nation and the world.
Three strategic goals guide us, building on our longstanding and emerging institutional strengths. This 
is the Oregon State University we will become:
• A university focused on big discoveries that drive big solutions. We will lead the world 
in building transdisciplinary teams in areas of strategic focus and turning our foundational 
strengths into accelerated applications with far-reaching, lasting public value.
• A university where every student graduates.  All degree seekers and their families will fully 
trust that their academic and professional success is Oregon State’s very highest priority. 
• A university that fuels a thriving world.  We will be a proactive driver of economic, workforce 
and community development, providing a model for research university engagement with 
people and places. This goal draws on both our knowledge and talents across the disciplines 
and our deep embeddedness in a state with extraordinary geographic, ecological, social and 
political diversity.
The plan’s three goals are interdependent: We must rally around them all to be successful — and 
that will require new ways of thinking and doing. We will improve the quality of individual lives by 
fully realizing our educational mission — one defined by access, improved educational outcomes and 
expanded online education. Doing so will also provide the financial means to enhance student support, 
increase need-based scholarships and fuel our research ambitions. And our ability to drive economic 
development is made possible both by cultivating a workforce educated for the future and by creating 
human-centered, sustainable solutions that emerge from big discoveries.
Our world is yearning for a sense of possibility. We respond with the clear-eyed optimism and 
pragmatic, scalable problem-solving that has always been our signature. This plan goes to the heart 
of who we are — and it reaffirms our determination to deliver on our public mission and reward the 
public’s trust — proving what public research universities can achieve.
We fervently believe that a bright future is within reach, with opportunities for all to contribute to and 
reap the rewards of prosperity widely shared. I know we are ready.

PresidentA MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
As we pursue these three 
goals, other essential 
work at the university 
continues, including 
initiatives outlined in the 
strategic plans of colleges 
and administrative units 
and work advancing 
universitywide 
initiatives already 
underway. Continuing 
our commitment to 
OSU student-athletes 
and competition at the 
highest level possible in 
college athletics and our 
goals alongside the OSU 
Foundation in the $1.75 
billion Believe It campaign 
will also fuel our success.
VISION
From our vantage points across Oregon and beyond, we see 
an inspiring constellation of strengths and the makings of a 
bright future. Oregon State University will be a driving force 
for prosperity that is equitable, scalable and sustainable.

This strategic plan comprises three  
primary sections:
Three Goals describe in broad terms what 
OSU is striving to achieve, articulating the 
rationale for pursuing these outcomes and 
identifying some of the associated implications 
and assumptions. These are the “whats” of the 
strategic plan.
Five Actions  elaborate big strategic 
undertakings through which the university 
will achieve the three goals, pursuing these 
at every level — university, campus, college, 
school and department — independently and 
collaboratively. These are the “hows” of the 
strategic plan.
Summary of Actions and Tactics  provides, in 
tabular form, three to five initial tactics for each 
action. These tactics are the “hows” with a more 
specific level of detail, allowing us to define clear 
progress metrics and hold ourselves accountable 
at all appropriate levels of the institution.
Following these core sections, the strategic 
plan identifies OSU’s Top Five Targets  — 
aspirational, measurable outcomes at the 
highest level for areas such as research 
expenditures, graduation rates and enrollment.
An implementation plan accompanies the 
strategic plan and provides more background 
information and details on how the tactics will 
be executed, along with timetables, milestones 
and identification of responsibility on the part of 
all individuals and units at the university.ORGANIZATION OF 
THE STRATEGIC PLAN

Prosperity will flourish when Oregon State 
research is fully powered up for excellence 
— intentionally concentrated in domains 
in which we are uniquely competitive and 
distinctive, making the most of our capacity 
for collaborative transdisciplinary discovery 
and leveraging entrepreneurship and public 
engagement. To begin embedding this culture 
of high strategic focus, this plan outlines four 
initial research areas where OSU has clear 
opportunities to build a global reputation and 
exert extraordinary impact: climate science and 
related solutions, robotics, clean energy and 
related solutions, and integrated health and 
biotechnology . In all cases, we will pursue these 
ambitions with transdisciplinary teams that work 
across the sciences, engineering, arts, social 
sciences and humanities.
Our intention to go big in selected areas will 
require a new mindset in how we prioritize, 
fund, staff, collaborate and problem-solve. 
We are confident that strategic, targeted 
investments will lift the entire university, open 
new opportunities in every discipline and create 
social, economic and environmental solutions 
with big impacts.
These focused initiatives will also create 
enduring university-community partnerships 
that will serve the state, the nation and the 
world far beyond the timeline of this plan: 
bridging differences, combating misinformation, 
inspiring more effective stewardship and 
facilitating greater civic participation. As we 
build these strengths, we will do so in ways 
that grow and sustain resilient, collaborative 
relationships with diverse community 
stakeholders, incorporate many ways of learning 
and knowing, and co-create solutions with 
benefits that are distributed fairly and equitably.
8A university focused on 
big discoveries that drive 
big solutions.
A university where every 
student graduates.
A university that fuels a 
thriving world.OREGON STATE WILL BE:THREE GOALS
This goal commits us to becoming a university 
deeply committed to the principle that every 
student we admit — in person or online — 
should achieve their goal to graduate. We 
are not gatekeepers; we are enablers. As an 
institution established in the public trust, we 
have the privilege and responsibility to keep 
open pathways to academic success and to do 
all we can to provide every student with the 
support necessary to succeed. We know we 
can do so without compromising our academic 
standards or the value of an Oregon State 
University degree.
We will continuously adapt to the rapidly 
evolving needs of learners and communities 
by strategically expanding academic programs 
and credentials and delivering them fluidly 
across Oregon State’s campuses and education 
platforms. We will build on the scale and 
reputation of Ecampus, which serves a growing 
number of degree-seekers of all ages and is 
consistently ranked among the nation’s top 
providers of degrees online. We can enrich 
pre-college engagement and Oregon State’s 
curriculum, teaching, experiential learning, 
academic support and career development. 
At the same time, we will offer educational 
opportunities for learners who seek shorter-
term credentialing programs to upskill and 
retool their careers. 
More a mindset than a metric, this goal will 
require us to productively disrupt many of 
the ways we are organized and approach our 
work. Every member of our community should 
approach their work, their responsibilities and 
their obligations toward the academic fulfillment 
and success of our students. 
10A university focused on 
big discoveries that drive 
big solutions.
A university where every 
student graduates.
A university that fuels a 
thriving world.OREGON STATE WILL BE:THREE GOALS
By combining exceptional research and teaching 
with an unparalleled capacity to partner with 
public and private stakeholders, Oregon State 
will serve as a powerful engine for widely 
shared, environmentally sustainable prosperity 
in our state, the nation and the world.
Working with partners in industry, government 
and education, we will help strengthen 
economies and communities by sharing Oregon 
State’s discoveries and capacity for joint 
problem-solving and by continuously adapting 
to the future of work in how we teach and 
prepare students for careers. We will be among 
the nation’s leaders in translating research to 
applications that contribute solutions to the 
world’s greatest challenges in areas like food, 
water, energy and climate change. We will be 
proactive and collaborative in creating the 
vision for — and helping to realize — dynamic, 
innovative and entrepreneurial economies  
and communities.
Purposefully engaging all disciplines, we will 
connect the analytic, humanistic and aesthetic 
in innovative ways to contribute understanding 
of how societies can fully realize the promise 
of new discoveries and technologies. To create 
a shared path forward, we will coordinate 
with the private sector; state, local and Tribal 
governments; and other educational institutions. 
Knowing true partnerships are built on trust, 
we will measure our leadership by whether we 
deliver on our commitment to collaboration  
and reciprocity.

12THREE GOALS
The following five actions and associated tactics will advance the three goals. We 
will pursue these actions at every level — university, campus, college, school and 
department — by defining clear progress metrics and holding ourselves accountable 
for results.FIVE ACTIONS
1
23
4
5Launch a campaign for timely undergraduate degree completion.
We will set and track bold but achievable targets for retention and graduation in every 
department, school and college, aiming also to equalize rates of retention and graduation 
by race and ethnicity. Partnering with the OSU Foundation, we will launch a campaign 
to substantially increase need-based scholarships. To incentivize and support more 
undergraduate students to attend full time, we will explore instating a block (or flat) tuition 
rate model. In addition, we will launch a signature first-year onboarding experience for 
undergraduate students, including reformed first-year advising and dedicated attention to 
transfer and online students, and we will strengthen relationships with other higher education 
institutions to create smoother pathways into Oregon State’s academic programs.
Build international research distinction in areas of competitive advantage.
Oregon State will maintain a breadth of disciplines and research appropriate for a 
comprehensive research university. However, we will be highly strategic at every level — 
university, campus, college, school and department — in building selected clusters of research 
excellence that are world-leading and underpinned by exceptional faculty, highly ranked 
undergraduate and graduate programs, and Oregon State’s unique assets.
To catalyze this culture of deliberate focus, over the next several years we will prioritize 
four areas for investment and growth: climate science and related solutions, clean energy 
technology and related solutions, robotics, and integrated health and biotechnology. To 
support work in these areas, we will build foundational strength across the university in 
artificial intelligence, data science and research computing, and we will consolidate and invest 
in infrastructure that will better support scholarship, creative work and research in the arts 
and humanities and their intersection with the target areas.
As we build the four target areas, we will take advantage of Oregon State’s current and 
emerging assets, including those associated with our specializations across 11 academic 
colleges; the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex; PRAx, the Patricia 
Valian Reser Center for the Creative Arts; centers and institutes such as the Linus Pauling 
Institute, PacWave and the world-renowned Hatfield Marine Science Center; OSU-Cascades; 
and our location in the ecologically and socioeconomically diverse Pacific Northwest. 
We will build accompanying strength in doctoral programs, and we will purposely take a 
multidisciplinary approach in each area, bringing together the expertise of scientists, artists, 
engineers, humanists and social scientists.Build an enterprise approach to knowledge translation, innovation 
and partnerships.
Urgent questions of global consequence — such as climate change and sustainability, the 
health and welfare of rural communities and marginalized people, and the diffusion of artificial 
intelligence — require solutions that are grounded in discovery but often have unclear paths 
to human-centered application. Elements of Oregon State’s approach to solving this problem 
include launching an economic development and industry relations strategy, strengthening 
our capacity to link research and its translation, launching a comprehensive strategy for our 
activity in the Portland region and leveraging global networks and partnerships to create 
additional competitive advantages in research and teaching.
Build faculty excellence.
In addition to our focus on the first four target areas for investment, all colleges will set goals 
for research and teaching excellence and innovation. A universitywide faculty hiring initiative, 
fueled in part by creating efficiencies and focusing priorities, will leverage college efforts. Even 
as we expand the work of colleges and the Office for Research Advancement in supporting 
faculty in their research endeavors, we will launch a campaign supporting faculty professional 
development in course design, teaching and assessment, and we will increase awards and 
recognition for distinguished teaching. We will also expand our efforts to increase the number 
of faculty recognized by national scientific and scholarly societies.
Significantly increase enrollment online and at OSU-Cascades.
An economy that is increasingly knowledge intensive is motivating more people to pursue 
degrees and build new skills over the course of their careers, and Oregon State plays a 
critical role by serving those needs, and in doing so, addressing state and national workforce 
requirements. What’s more, demand for quality online academic programs is growing, and 
competitors are striving to capture market share. In this context, it is imperative that we 
expand our online programs to offer educational opportunities to more students, remain 
competitive, and fuel investments in student success, faculty excellence and research. 
Developing and executing ambitious plans in every college, we will strive to more than double 
online enrollment, and we will implement growth strategies for OSU-Cascades, the Corvallis 
campus and our professional master’s degree offerings.

18 19Oregon State’s most recent strategic plan — covering 2019 
through 2023 — articulated four goals and 20 actions designed 
to lay the groundwork for success for OSU’s next 150 years. 
The university successfully implemented nearly all the tactics 
originally envisioned in SP4.0 and introduced new tactics 
as challenges and opportunities evolved. Some of that work 
remains underway and is essential to achieving the goals laid 
out here.
Accompanying this strategic plan is an implementation plan. 
Additionally, the Office of Institutional Diversity will lead the 
development of a diversity action plan that will articulate 
how the university will pursue the goals and actions laid out 
here in alignment with our core diversity, equity and inclusion 
commitments. Finally, the Office of Human Resources will work 
with university partners to update OSU’s talent management 
strategy to ensure we are taking every action within our control 
— hiring practices, onboarding, professional development, 
increased options for affordable housing, child care and general 
assistance — to recruit and retain outstanding and diverse 
academic and professional faculty and staff.IMPLEMENTATION
