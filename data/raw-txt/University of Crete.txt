 University of Crete Strategic Plan 2018 -20251 
 
The University of Crete at the beginning of the 21st century : an international centre of 
excellence in research and education  
 
The University of Crete aims to build on both the tradition created by the quality of its 
academic activity and its close relationships with the research and innovation ecosystem of 
Crete, as well as the exceptional quality and diversity of life in Crete, in order to become one 
of the world’s top 200 Universities by 2025.  
 
We recognize that global trends in wealth and power, labor market diversification and rapid 
changes in the world of research and technology are intensifying international competition 
between universities to attract high -quality staff and students as well as public and private 
resources. These trends also raise questions about the social mission of the university at 
local, national and international levels.  
 
In this context, the UoC will a dhere to  the principles governing its functioning: democratic 
governance, excellence in cutting -edge research, linking research and education, 
international orientation and developing partnerships with leading institutions in the world 
as well as attracti ng high level staff  with open  procedures and excellent undergraduate and 
postgraduate students.  At the same time, measures will be taken to increase productivity 
and better organize UoC operations, while also seeking to resolve institutional issues  that 
make it difficult to achieve its strategic goals.

Axis 2: An attractive educational centre for young scientists and responsible citizens  
 
2.1. Education  
The rapid pace of technological and socio -economic change impacts  not only the graduate 
labour market , but  also the frequency and extent of changes affecting the lives of graduates.  
 
3 
 Accordingly, the skills required of  University graduates differ from those that were desirable 
or necessary in the 20th century. Aware of th ese trends, the UoC aims to equip students 
with the necessary skills and competences to cope with the associated challenges , and to 
improve their career prospects, by cultivating critical learning, academic breadth, real 
problem solving, collaborative skills , an understanding of reality in the fields of science, 
society and the economy as well as a sense of social responsibility.

today in the UoC . 
 
2.3. Nurturing the professional development of our graduates  
Knowledge has independent value, but mass entry into higher education is normally 
accompanied by  expectations for a better professional futu re. Despite the fact that the 
professional future s of students vary considerably, even among those who have studied the 
same subject, and differ  significantly over time, the UoC has a duty to  nurture the 
professional development of our graduates . This includes  not only e quipping students  with  
knowledge and skills , but also familiarizing them with  the labor market  through organized 
contacts . 
 
By 2025 the UoC is committed to  
 The numerical and thematic expansion  of the network of internship opportunities  
 Creating  better records of graduates and better communica tion forums with alumni

Axis 3: Resources for Development and Modernization  
 
3.1. Infrastructure   
The infrastructure of the University is c rucial both for the quality of research and for  the 
quality of life  of staff and  students.  The UoC  aim is for continuous upgrading of the research 
infrastructure of all the institutions of the research ecosystem of Crete to support high level 
collaborative  research between the participating institutions  as well as joint re search 
activities with partners worldwide.  Housing infrastructure is also an important resource for 
securing accommodation for students from out side Crete, as well as for scientific 
collaborators and participants in summer schools, conferences and other scientific events 
that require mobility.

current capacity so that the University  can  respond  better to its social mission  and 
overcome disadvantages deriving from  its regional position  
 Improve infrastructure for sports and cultural activities , with facilities at the Gallos 
Campus in Rethymnon as a priority  
 
3.2. Economic Resources  
The University needs con tinual  renewal and upgrading t o be able to provide high quality 
education and research. This presupposes obtaining resources from a variety of sources, 
especially as the resources available from the state are i ncreasingly limited and the 
mechanisms for their utilization are becoming increasingly rigid. It is ther efore imperative  to 
seek the establishment of an institutional framework that will ensure adequate levels  and 
flexibility in the use of state funding , and  also for UoC academic staff to attract funded 
research and educational programmes  from which a small percentage  can be invested  in 
actions of high added value to improve the image of UoC , teaching, research and the social 
contribution of the University . 
By 2025 the UoC aims  to 
 Restructure and improve policy for the  use of UoC assets

 Conclude joint programme agreements with  companies for technology transfer  
 Attract sponsors and donations in critical areas of development for UoC  
3.3. Human  Resources  
The University needs adequate staffing, both in terms of teaching and research staff and in 
terms of administrative and technical  staff. The recruitment of new staff in all categories is 
necessary both to ensure a balanced age distribution and to attrac t people wit h new 
expertise /competences  in emerging areas of activity. In an ever -evolving academic 
landscape with new challenges and demands, human resources must also e volve and take 
on new roles and responsibilities that are necessary to realize  high quality  education and 
resear ch. Implementation of the UoC strategy depends on the dynamism , enthusiasm, 
ingenuity and perseverance o f the University ’s human resources and its ab ility to harness 
this HR potential  to achieve UoC goals.
