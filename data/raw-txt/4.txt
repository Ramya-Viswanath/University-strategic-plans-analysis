 Common values1 
Uppsala University upholds the free pursuit of knowledge in education and research and stands  up 
for academic integrity, diversity and quality. The independence of universities is a cornerstone of 
democracy . Moreover, it is  an essential prerequisite for the freedom of individuals to choose their 
education and the ability of research to provide sus tainable solutions to the challenges facing society. 
The University seeks to contribute to open and knowledge -based public debate with freedom of 
expression and human rights at its heart.  
Academic freedom, collegial governance and student influence are fun damental principles at the 
University. All staff and students share a responsibility for the University’s development. The 
University’s activities are characterised by equal opportunities. The internal culture is distinguished 
by open, objective and critic al discussion in which ideas and scholarly theories are constantly 
reformulated and questioned. The credibility of science and good research practice are defended. 
The University will preserve and enhance its diversity and its role and visibility in societ y. 
The University is regulated as a government agency and is therefore subject to legislation on its 
governance, requirements for the correct legal management of official business, and other matters. 
Collegial influence plays a central role in the organisa tion. The University has a decision -making 
structure in which academic leaders are appointed for fixed periods on the proposal of electoral 
colleges or elected assemblies, and academically qualified individuals are in the majority in 
management bodies that  decide on the contents and quality of education and research. The students 
have an active role in the University’s operations, are involved in educational development and 
participate in consultations and decisions.

 Foreword  
Uppsala University aspires to strengthen its position as a world -leading university. This requires 
education and research to play a prominent role in society and enjoy public confidence. The 
University also needs to hold an autonomous position with respect to the government, the busine ss 
sector and funding bodies. Uppsala University contributes to development and innovation locally 
and nationally and is an active party in the pursuit of sustainable social development.  
Uppsala  University’s status and credibility in society depend in tur n on the University behaving in a 
responsible, transparent and inclusive manner, and standing up for fundamental ethical principles, 
democratic values and equal opportunities.  
The University also needs an ability to continuously develop and renew its educ ation and research, 
so as to meet steadily changing circumstances and challenges in society and working life. This 
means ensuring that education and research environments have sufficient inherent capacity for 
renewal, and creating scope to allow new initia tives to arise.  
Uppsala University: Mission, Goals and Strategies  is intended to enhance the University’s status as 
a globally leading higher education institution, its position in society and its capacity to continually 
renew itself so as to meet present and future challenges.  
This document describes the University’s g oals and ambitions in the short and long term, along with 
fundamental requirements for achieving them. It focuses more on the goals – what  the University 
wants to achieve and why – than on strategies for how to achieve the goals. This is a conscious 
choice . The University’s breadth, diversity and decentralised decision -making organisation make it 
natural to lay down overall goals at University -wide level. By and large, the business of fleshing out 
the goals and designing strategies for achieving them belong s more at an operational level in the 
disciplinary domains, faculties and departments.  
Achieving our common goals requires the involvement of all of the University’s employees and 
students. Working and studying at Uppsala University entails certain obliga tions. The University 
must encourage and support staff and students to enable them to develop their fields, methods and 
organisations freely, boldly and with integrity. Having said that, this presupposes a joint assumption 
of responsibility for the broader  research and education environment through collegial commitment, 
a positive staff culture and active student participation.

 Education and research for a better world  
The mission of Uppsala University is to gain and disseminate knowledge for the benefit of 
humankind and for a better world. The University is part of and defends the open society. Education 
enriches society with knowledge and fosters active and critically thinking members of society. Those 
who are educated at Uppsala University acquire knowledge, skills and approaches that enable them 
to participate in and lead the future development and renewal of society, and to engage in continued, 
lifelong learning.  
Our research advances the frontiers of knowledge and develops methods to better understand 
fundamental natural, human and social phenomena, as well as contributing by scientific methods to 
solutions and knowledge bases for major societal issues. Uppsala Univ ersity is open to the wider 
community. External collaboration is an integral part of research and education and contributes to 
sustainable solutions to the challenges facing society.  
The University rests on the idea and fundamental premise that investment s in education and research 
contribute to a better future. Our University will put all its breadth and combined strength into 
supporting sustainable development, engaging with the wider community and promoting openness 
and respect.  
Sustainable development – the most important challenge facing 
society  
The present and future challenges facing society largely concern the need for sustainability. The 
UN’s 2030 Agenda contains 17 sustainable development goals. The concept of sustainable 
development is understood  in a broad sense  and the goals are challenging. They span economic, 
social, political, technological and ecological aspects and involve local, regional and global 
perspectives.  
As a full -scale research university, with deep specialist knowledge and a skil ls base that ranges 
across a great diversity of fields, Uppsala University is well equipped to contribute to sustainable 
development. If this potential is to be fully realised,  the necessary subject specialisation must be 
supplemented by  increased efforts to initiate and carry out transdisciplinary education and research, 
as well as further development of the University’s many interfaces for collaboration.  
Uppsala University aspires to a leading role in the transition  to a more sustainable society. The 
education and research we conduct translate into new knowledge, better technology, improvements 
in the organisation of society and changed patterns of behaviour. The University will also contribute 
to sustainable development in its own activities. This requir es us to set an example in the 
management of finite resources and to actively address the climate impact of our own activities.  
Collaboration in education and research  
The University operates at the heart of the society to which it belongs. In both education and 
research, contacts and interaction with other  actors in society and industry are crucial. Collaboration 
enables  the academic knowledge base to make an impact and  be of use in society, while also 
providing new inspiration for education and research.  
Collaboration with the wider community locally, nationally and internationally is a natural and 
integral part of education and research. In a comprehensive university, collaboration will obviously 
assume varying forms and involve varying content in differe nt fields. However, collaboration is 
fundamentally equally relevant for all parts of the University, no matter whether the external partner 
is a company, a government agency, a local authority or region, or a civil society organisation. All 
UPPSALA UNIVERSITY  UPPSALA UNIVERSITY:  MISSION, GOALS AND 
STRATEGIES

 collaboration i s predicated on respect for the integrity of science and an understanding that the 
University operates under different conditions and with different goals than companies and other 
collaboration partners.  
Equal opportunities and gender equality – for attrac tive, open 
and inclusive environments for study and work  
Equal opportunities are a matter of rights for the individual and quality for the University. An equal 
opportunities perspective must be mainstreamed in all parts of the organisation and the Universi ty’s 
study and work environments must be characterised by openness och respect.  
What we mean by ‘equal opportunities’ is that everyone working or studying at or contacting the 
University has equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their legal sex, g ender identity or gender 
expression, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation, age or social background. 
Systematic efforts are needed to widen participation to reflect the social and ethnic diversity of 
society. Teachers, resear chers and students must be able to participate in and contribute to all parts 
of the University’s activities, whatever their background or gender.    
Fundamental principles of openness, legality, impartiality, freedom of opinion, transparency and 
respect ap ply to university staff as they do to all public employees.

 Overall goal: education and research of the highest 
quality and relevance  
Uppsala University’s overall goal is to conduct education and research of the highest quality and 
relevance. The University is an integrated environment for education and research. The backbone of 
our activities is outstanding education and research across  a broad range of fields in which staff and 
students together create a rich environment for education and knowledge.  
Uppsala University will maintain and develop a leading national and international position that 
makes us attractive to staff and students,  as an international partner for educational and research 
cooperation, and as a collaboration partner for other actors in society. This position both builds on 
and assumes that we achieve our overall goal: to conduct education and research of the highest 
quality and relevance. Our education and research must place us on a par in terms of quality with the 
best universities in comparable knowledge nations.  
Learning and research environment for quality and relevance  
Education  of the highest quality grows  out of the interaction between teachers and students. The 
contents and educational approach build on  a scientific foundation. Our courses and  programmes 
attract motivated students who contribute to educational development by means of active 
participation and c onstructive dialogue. They give students the opportunity to acquire knowledge, 
skills and approaches that enable them to meet the needs of society. The range of programmes 
offered and contents of courses evolve in dialogue with alumni and representatives o f the world of 
work and contribute to lifelong learning.  
Research  of the highest quality is conducted in accordance with good research practice and carried 
out independently, skilfully and boldly. It is innovative and distinguished by scholarly depth. Our  
research seeks answers to the most important questions, within the discipline or in a broader societal 
perspective, and helps to advance the frontiers of knowledge. Collaboration with the wider 
community is a natural, integral part of such research and co ntributes – directly or indirectly – to 
solutions to the sustainability challenges facing society. The ultimate goal is for research results to 
make a difference in society in the long term.  
A good learning and research environment  is secure, stimulating and challenging for students, 
teachers and researchers. It is distinguished by openness, intense scholarly discussion, a culture of 
quality and renewal, equal opportunities, a good work environment and respectful relations between 
students and members of s taff. Such environments offer both physical and digital infrastructure, in 
the form of libraries, lecture halls, study spaces, pedagogical aids and research infrastructure.  
Students must have good conditions for study and their psychosocial situation must be noticed and 
improved. A good study environment trains the ability of students to acquire, compare and critically 
examine different perspectives, theories and methods. A good research environment is characterised 
by a high attendance rate, active partici pation in seminars , and opportunities for planned and 
unplanned meetings. Individual researchers strive to maximise the quality of their own research and 
take collegial responsibility for the overall environment.  
Strengths and challenges  
Uppsala University is a research -oriented higher education institution. Research and third -cycle 
(doctoral) education account for more than 70 per cent of the balance -sheet total. The balance 
between research and education varies between disciplinary domains and f aculties, and still more 
between individual departments. Strengthening the connection between education and research is a

8 
 challenge throughout the University. Another challenge is to create conditions for increasing the 
volume of education, both in terms o f an expanded educational mandate from the state and by 
increasing the number of students paying tuition fees.  
Uppsala University performs strongly in student recruitment, both nationally and internationally. 
The University offers a rich experience, in whi ch students’ unions, student nations and other student 
associations contribute to an attractive educational and study environment. Uppsala has student 
exchange agreements with around 400 foreign universities and the number of internationally 
recruited stud ents is increasing. Having said that, there is scope to further increase our attractiveness 
as an educational institution.  
The capacity to conduct top quality third -cycle  education in many different subjects is a particular 
strength. At the same time, it is a challenge to offer all doctoral students a research environment that 
is conducive to their development.  
Uppsala University has a decentralised organisation with strong disciplines and autonomous 
departments, faculties and disciplinary domains. The Uni versity’s internal organisation, educational 
programmes and career systems are largely structured along disciplinary lines. In essential respects, 
development is driven by initiatives from below.  
One of the strengths of the University lies in the many indi viduals, groups and environments that 
strive for excellence in education and research. The University performs well in terms of its ability 
to attract resources for research projects in the face of competition when the criterion is scientific 
excellence. O ur research is published in leading journals or by high -profile publishers.  
The strength that lies in intradisciplinary basic research needs to be supplemented by initiatives to 
stimulate challenge -driven research, which often requires both transdisciplina ry cooperation within 
the University and well -developed collaboration with other actors in society. However, the 
decentralisation and emphasis on initiatives from below make it a challenge to bring about powerful, 
coordinated initiatives. Research infrastr ucture is increasingly large -scale and expensive, placing 
growing demands on the academic leadership at various levels to achieve prioritisation and 
concerted efforts.

 Development goals for education and research  
Based on the strengths and challenges identified above, six development goals are formulated for 
education and research at Uppsala University. These goals will guide the development work 
conducted at various levels. They are intended to reinforce the ability to stimulate, take up and 
prioritis e between good initiatives for the renewal of education and research.  
1. Expand education and strengthen the connection between 
education and research  
The range of courses and programmes offered will be varied and flexible so as to stimulate tailor -
made de grees with unique combinations of subjects and lifelong learning. Contract education will be 
offered to meet the needs of society and individuals. Work on developing eLearning and student -
activating types of instruction will be stepped up. More courses and  programmes will integrate 
methods for managing large quantities of data and exploiting the potential offered by digitalisation 
and artificial intelligence. The University will strive to increase the volume of education, focusing 
on: 
 Being the first -choice  alternative for Swedish students and attracting more international 
students.  
 Increasing the range of internationally advertised second -cycle (Master’s) programmes with 
strong links to research.  
 Increasing the number of places in freestanding courses.  
 Developing more transdisciplinary programmes and courses based on new combinations of 
subjects, preferably across disciplinary domain boundaries.  
 Ensuring the volume and breadth of third -cycle  education and that all doctoral students 
belong to or have acces s to a stimulating doctoral education environment.  
2. Develop research excellence and strengthen the capacity to 
attract prestigious grants in international competition  
A publicly funded research university has a particular responsibility to create condi tions for the long -
term, curiosity -driven quest for knowledge that inspires the most fundamental research. The strength 
that lies in individual researchers and teams driving the frontiers of knowledge forward through top -
quality basic research must  be nurt ured and further developed. The transition to open science must 
take place while respecting and preserving the quality -driven mechanisms that exist in established 
academic publishing. The University will work to:  
 Maintain its nationally leading position in  the competition for untied research funding.  
 Strengthen its capacity to attract excellence funding in international competition, not least 
from the European Research Council, by more clearly supporting researchers applying for 
such funding.  
 Be a leader in terms of proactive promotion of good research practice and ethics, and offer 
good support and good infrastructure for secure storage and open availability of data.  
3. Strengthen transdisciplinary and challenge -driven research  
The University will develo p more high -profile, thematically oriented research environments, 
particularly linked to sustainable social development. Researchers with different disciplinary 
backgrounds will cooperate on common problems, in collaboration with partners and stakeholders 
outside the university sector. Forms for organising transdisciplinary initiatives will be developed to 
UPPSALA UNIVERSITY  UPPSALA UNIVERSITY:  MISSION, GOALS AND 
STRATEGIES  
  
 12 December 2019  UFV 2018/641  
 
10 
 ensure that emerging thematic initiatives are linked to existing discipline -oriented research 
environments and support the connection between research an d education. The University will work 
to: 
 Strengthen its capacity to obtain external research resources from funding bodies that 
primarily support challenge - and needs -driven research, such as Vinnova, Formas, the 
Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environme ntal Research (Mistra) and the Swedish 
Foundation for Strategic Research, in Sweden, and from the European framework 
programmes.  
4. Coordinate and concentrate the University’s resources  
The University will strengthen its capacity to carry out concentrated, coordinated initiatives in 
education and research, and not least in the area of infrastructure. Conditions will be improved for 
developing proposals, coordinating priorities and pooling resources. This will make it possible to 
free up scope f or new prioritised educational, research and infrastructure initiatives. The University 
will work to:  
 Establish systems  – at department, faculty, disciplinary domain and University level – that 
encourage the regular production and prioritisation of proposa ls for new initiatives and their 
insertion into ordinary operational planning processes.  
5. Exploit the potential of Campus Gotland  
The education and research environment at Campus Gotland offers particularly good opportunities 
for testing new paths and e xploiting the potential of multi - and interdisciplinarity and regional 
collaboration. Campus Gotland will contribute to the capacity of the University to meet the 
challenges facing society in the future, for example in the area of sustainable development. Campus 
Gotland will be a living environment with a high presence of staff and students. The target of 1,500 
full-time equivalent students at Campus Gotland lays the foundation for continued development. The 
University will work to:  
 Create organisational co nditions for integration and multidisciplinary cooperation at 
Campus Gotland within the framework of the model incorporating activities at Campus 
Gotland in the University’s faculty structure.  
6. Develop collaboration as an integral part of education and 
research  
The University will take a proactive and coordinated approach to collaboration, both as a means of 
increasing the quality and relevance of the University’s education and research, and as a means of 
turning new knowledge to account in society. The p erception that collaboration is an integral part of 
education and research will be more widely embraced throughout the University. The University will 
work to:  
 Clarify incentives for developing expertise in collaboration as an aspect of pedagogical and 
research expertise.  
 Further facilitate the creation of long -term, mutual collaborative relationships in both 
education and research.  
 Further strengthen cooperation with the University’s strategically most important partners, 
including Region Uppsala and Upp sala University Hospital.

 Strategic priorities  
Alongside the development goals, Uppsala University is actively seeking to advance the general 
conditions for education and research of the highest quality and relevance. The University’s efforts 
focus on f ive strategic priorities. These are quality assurance and enhancement, internationalisation, 
education and research infrastructure, talent attraction and career systems, and support functions and 
the wider university environment. These priorities are gener al prerequisites for the development of 
education and research.   
Quality assurance and enhancement  
The University’s quality assurance and enhancement system is based on the existing culture of 
academic quality, which is actively maintained, continuously reviewed and renewed by staff and 
students, with the support of management at all levels. A good bala nce must be struck between 
quality assurance and quality enhancement, and between what is regulated in common and what is 
shaped within departments, faculties and disciplinary domains. The quality assurance and 
enhancement system will lead to needs -driven analyses and measures, and will contribute to 
education and research of the highest quality and relevance.  
Staff and students share the responsibility for quality assurance and enhancement . The University 
management has overall responsibility. Each discip linary domain/faculty is responsible for the 
quality of education and research in its own field. At departments, the head of department is 
responsible for the quality of activities.  
Education and research of the highest quality and relevance builds on the  premise that the University 
as a whole, with all its education and research environments, is animated by academic values and an 
established and open culture of quality. Various forms of external review play a vital role, along with  
knowledge and experienc e exchange. Ensuring that these systems are in place and operate  well is a 
responsibility of management at all levels. University -wide quality assurance and enhancement 
guidelines set the framework for these proce sses and are balanced against the requireme nts and 
demands of the Swedish government and parliament, society and other stakeholders.  
 
Quality assurance and enhancement will safeguard and promote the quality of education and 
research  
Quality assurance and enhancement  will prevent, identify and remedy failings, support effective 
operations, and encourage improvements and innovative thinking. Quality assurance and 
enhancement  will be systematic, include all teachers, researchers and students, and inform day -to-
day activi ties. 
Quality assurance and enhancement will emanate from and strengthen the academic and 
collegial culture  
Quality assurance and enhancement  will be an integral part of the academic culture and will apply a 
scientific approach based on objectively support ed analysis and peer review, along with 
dissemination of results and experience.  
Quality assurance and enhancement will be transparent, effective and efficient  
Quality assurance and enhancement  will be decentralised, tailored to local conditions in the 
University’s disciplinary domains and where necessary coordinated. Quality assurance and 
enhancement  will be designed to maintain a good balance between resources used and benefit. The 
quality assu rance and enhancement  system, its components and the division of responsibilities will 
be known to teachers, researchers and students, and to external stakeholders.

 Internationalisation  
The University operates in a global context. Internationalisation is n ot an end in itself; it is a strategy 
that supports the University’s development and contributes to the quality and relevance of education 
and research. International recruitment of staff and students enhances our skills base and widens our 
educational ran ge. International research cooperation improves the quality of our research. 
Improving and strengthening Uppsala University as a dynamic and lively environment for education 
and research requires active, careful and focused internationalisation efforts. In ternational 
cooperation, like all the University’s activities, must be based on our common, fundamental values.  
International cooperation and exchange will be deepened  
Increased international cooperation and exchange are conducive to  the renewal and devel opment of 
education and research. Students at Uppsala University must always be aware of links to current 
research and, when possible and relevant, be included in an internationally oriented research 
environment. Research at Uppsala University aims to cont ribute at the forefront of international 
research and promote a globally sustainable development of society.  
Internationalisation will drive quality and enhance skills  
Staff and students will be given the opportunity to acquire intercultural skills so as t o improve their 
potential to develop and compete in a global perspective. Collaboration with both public and private 
actors abroad will be intensified to further the usefulness of education and research in a global 
perspective. More members of staff and st udents will spend time abroad or gain international 
experience in some other way.  
The University will be an attractive choice for teachers, researchers and students from all over 
the world  
Good education and research environments at Uppsala University will  be safeguarded and enhanced 
by harnessing the skills and diversity of experiences possessed by teachers, researchers and students 
with backgrounds in other countries. The University’s education and research environments must be 
prepared to manage the chal lenges and needs of internationally recruited teachers, researchers and 
students. Teachers and researchers with linguistic backgrounds other than Swedish will be better 
integrated across the University’s entire range of activities: in education, research, administration 
and management positions. The University’s educational programmes will be attractive and 
competitive in a global perspective.  
Infrastructure  
Infrastructure is a key resource for education and research at an internationally leading universit y. 
Access to learning environments, research facilities, experimental equipment, databases, libraries, 
collections and biobanks paves the way for scientific and scholarly breakthroughs and knowledge 
creation. Access to world -class facilities lays a foundation for strengthening the position of Uppsala 
University as an internationally leading and attractive research university. The University will 
continue to develop good education and research infrastructure to support and contribute to the 
renewal o f education and research. This requires a long -term perspective that takes account of 
existing national and international strategies for education and research infrastructure.  
Appropriate infrastructure will support education  
The University will provide ap propriate and flexible physical and digital infrastructure for education. 
All types of teaching premises need development and modernisation to accommodate new teaching 
technology for both on -campus and distance education, new teaching and learning methods,  and 
advanced apparatus and computer infrastructure for education. The learning environments and 
educational resources offered must be accessible to all students regardless of any disabilities.

STRATEGIES  
  
 12 December 2019  UFV 2018/641  
 
13 
 Strategy work and processes for prioritisation in research inf rastructure will be strengthened  
The University will develop its internal strategy work on research infrastructure to reinforce 
systematic and coordinated efforts, whether national or local, such as prioritisation processes and 
structures to guarantee lon g-term funding and governance. Uppsala will be a clear voice in the 
shaping of national research infrastructure strategies.  
More use will be made of existing research infrastructures  
Existing research infrastructure and facilities need to be given greater  visibility and prominence to 
improve use and coordination and to enhance the University’s attractiveness. Conditions will be 
improved for collaboration on research infrastructure, for example in education, industry and 
society. This will benefit the Unive rsity through  increased knowledge transfer and by making the 
usefulness of research more visible.  
Talent attraction and career systems  
Well -qualified teachers, researchers and other staff are crucial to enable the University to achieve its 
overall goal of conducting education and research of the highest quality and relevance. Good 
education depends on teachers who are engaged in research. Uppsala University aims to  be an 
inspiring environment that enables teachers, researchers and students to develop academ ically and 
professionally, and that makes the most of a diversity of experiences and individual initiatives. The 
pursuit of excellence and the needs of education and research will govern the approach to talent 
attraction and career paths. Criteria and proc edures for assessing qualifications and potential in 
recruitment and promotion processes must be relevant, transparent and reliable, regardless of 
whether they concern the assessment of research, educational, collaboration or leadership qualities, 
administ rative qualifications or personal suitability.  
Successful talent attraction and clear career paths demand long -term, organised action to enable the 
University to attract, recruit and develop skilful teachers, researchers and other staff. Adjunct 
teachers w ill be recruited in close dialogue with external parties and their recruitment will broaden 
the University’s expertise and strengthen long -term external collaboration.  
Teaching staff will be given opportunities for professional development in teaching and learning in 
higher education and subject teaching. Conditions will be created for teachers to develop their 
educational skills and to enable them to apply for distingui shed university teacher status. Educational 
leaders will be supported in developing their own role, and in initiating, stimulating and 
implementing educational development work.  
This strategy partly reflects implementation of the European Charter for Rese archers and Code of 
Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (Charter & Code).  
Recruitment will follow an analysis of skills needed and strategic considerations  
Work on talent attraction programmes will be developed to make considerations of long -term 
recruitment and development needs an integral part of the continuous strategic discussion at all 
levels of the University.  
The University will offer clear academic career paths  
The University will give all members of staff career development opportunities. Staff in teaching 
positions may enter in a career -development position or be recruited at a higher level. Recruitment to 
the position of associate senior lecturer (assistant professor) has an increasingly key role as the first 
step on the ac ademic career ladder. It must be ensured that such recruitment occurs on a strictly 
meritocratic basis, and the tenure track system must be clarified. Research and teaching staff, 
including doctoral students, will be offered career guidance.

form of higher education, and work at the interface of core and support activities. Clear career paths 
and good development opportunities a re essential to recruit and retain competent staff in this 
category.  
Support and wider environment  
Uppsala University is a meeting place for knowledge, culture and critical dialogue. The University 
aims to offer an inspiring and well -functioning physical, social and cultural environment. The 
cultural heritage, traditions and active student scene are important aspects of the wider educational 
context . Well -functioning work and education environments underpin education and research of the 
highest quality and relevance.  
Uppsala University operates in urban settings that are characterised by development and 
regeneration, both in Uppsala and in Visby. The Uppsala region has a great capacity to attract 
people, companies and organisations with knowledge, skills and  capital. Uppsala University will be 
an active driver in innovation systems in Uppsala and on Gotland and will contribute to sustainable 
community planning. Scope will be provided for regeneration and development while allowing 
traditions and historical va lues to help create an attractive, open and inclusive environment.  
Uppsala and Visby have unique university settings . Cultural values must be preserved, but equally, 
present -day staff and students must experience their surroundings  as both secure and livi ng. In 
collaboration with the local and regional authorities and other external actors, the University will 
actively conduct long -term planning of both physical and social environments.  
The University’s operational support services consist of the University Administration, Uppsala 
University Library, Uppsala University Innovation and support functions at disciplinary domains, 
faculties and departments. The administrative support, advice a nd expertise provided by operational 
support services provide  a framework that enables  the University to conduct its principal tasks and 
achieve its overall goal. Operational support services also ensure that the University performs its 
duties as a governm ent agency in a legal and economical  manner.  
Operational support will be coordinated, efficient and quality -enhancing  
University -wide and local support functions must interact with and reinforce one another. Increased 
coordination and a clear division of r esponsibilities and duties will ensure the quality and efficiency 
of the University’s support functions. The resources allocated to support functions must be used 
cost-effectively and must always be guided by the needs of the University’s core activities. The 
University’s operational support services will develop their working methods and administrative 
processes on the basis of context analysis and research -based knowledge.  
Technology and support will be developed for meetings and eLearning  
The technology  for digital and virtual meetings must be accessible, robust and easy to use. With 
activities on Gotland and widespread educational and research partnerships, Uppsala University 
needs to b e at the cutting edge of technology and skills for such meetings. Th is requires investments 
in new technology and skills enhancement.
