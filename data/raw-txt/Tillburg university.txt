 1.  Introduction 
1.1 School of Social and Behavioral Sciences  
The Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences (TSB) encompasses a unique set of areas of 
expertise with Psychology, Sociology, Organization Studies, Human Resource Studies, and Tranzo. This 
allows our School to understand social and behavioral issues from an individual, organizational, and a 
societal perspective. Currently, more than 4,500 students are following a TSB degree program. Until 
2021, more than 17,500 students graduated from our programs.  
 
1.2 Rolling, Connected Strategy toward 2027 
This strategy document focuses on the path we would like TSB to take toward 2027. Its purpose is to 
focus and guide the School in making decisions in the coming strategy period. The ongoing and 
sometimes rapid developments in our organization and in our relevant environments call for a strategy 
that is not set in stone but that can develop continuously. To achieve this, and in line with the 
university strategy, we have developed a “rolling strategy,” which is robust and flexible. It includes not 
only new1 key decisions that we will implement but also areas that we will first explore with 
stakeholders before making decisions. Moreover, during the 6-year strategic period, additional action 
lines can be developed in line with any upcoming and unforeseen needs and opportunities. 
 
1.3 Document Structure 
In Chapter 2, we present the School’s mission statement and vision, followed by the core values that 
shape our strategy. In Chapter 3, we highlight some of the major developments that are relevant for 
our future strategy. In Chapters 4 and 5, we elaborate on the goals and action lines for education and 
research, respectively. In Chapter 6, regarding the School’s third key activity, impact, we present ideas 
for improving the connections between our education and research and the outside world. Finally, in 
Chapter 7, we discuss how we can ensure that our staff, through appropriate policies, support, and 
facilities, perform to the best of their abilities in the key activities mentioned above.  
 Three appendices are attached to this document. Appendix 1 lists the action lines of the new 
strategy. Appendix 2 provides an evaluation of the previous 2018–2021 strategic plan. Finally, 
Appendix 3 presents our School’s key facts and figures.   
 
1  This document primarily focuses on new strategic choices. Important elements of the former strategy that 
are already well embedded in current policies and budgets, such as internationalization of education, 
preparing students for the labor market, improving support for PhD candidates, or increasing the number of 
female full professors are, therefore, not included in this strategy.

 2.  Mission, Vision, and Values 
2.1 Mission 
It is TSB’s mission to identify, develop, test, and share the mechanisms of change—society & citizens, 
organizations & labor, and data &technology—that contribute to society’s transitions. We wish to be 
nationally and internationally recognized in the field of social and behavioral sciences as 
• leading in research and education in our fields of expertise; 
• leading in the development and implementation of state-of-the-art research methodology; 
• a reliable partner for regional and national stakeholders in developing and testing effective 
strategies for dealing with current and future transitions in society; 
• a hotbed for the development of diverse and specific talents for individuals and teams in research, 
education, impact, and leadership.  
 
2.2 Vision 
In our vision for 2027, TSB is an open and inclusive community where students and staff feel safe, 
recognized, and valued and their talents are allowed to flourish. Our School is an attractive 
environment for scientists who want to push the boundaries of their fields through collaboration with 
other scientists, students, and external stakeholders. Scientists are challenged to enrich their 
disciplines, reach out to other disciplines at Tilburg University, develop new (trans)disciplines, and/or 
develop theme-based research that links multiple disciplinary strengths and areas of expertise. They 
are provided with sufficient time for their tasks, access to rich datasets, innovative (digital) 
methodologies and facilities, and an extensive network. Research and education activities are 
strengthened by teamwork. Teams can be broad based and across Departments. In this way, our staff 
can divide tasks and use their different talents. Teams can also include support staff for the purpose 
of activities such as data management, grant acquisition and project management, curriculum 
development and quality assessment, and community management. External stakeholders can be part 
of these teams as well, for example, in advisory roles, as research partners, in supplying students with 
real-world challenges, or serving as hosts for student internships. 
 
2.3 Values  
TSB operates from four specific values. 
 
We are Curious 
Curiosity is intrinsic to the work we do. Scientists at TSB continually ask questions about how society 
and people operate, what factors underlie such observations, and how to do research that matters to 
society. Curiosity means fostering an environment in which we allow more time for reflection to find 
new angles or new questions to old problems. Moreover, curiosity is an important part of the 
education and training that we offer as these are aimed at stimulating and strengthening curiosity 
among our Bachelor’s and Master’s students. We do so in several ways, for example, by introducing 
students to wicked problems for which multiple perspectives and multidisciplinary teamwork are 
needed and by offering excellent training to students pursuing academic research careers. Curiosity 
also applies to our non-academic staff, who know the scientists they support and who are eager to 
continuously learn about and adopt ways to improve services. 
 
We are Courageous 
We foster a culture in which we dare to take bold steps. We try out new avenues of research, develop 
new modes of education, and offer new services and new ways to recognize and reward talents whilst 
doing our utmost to succeed and accepting and even celebrating when we fail. This means that we 
4 
 encourage our people and teams to be frontrunners, that we allocate resources to innovation and 
experimentation, and that we dare challenge ourselves to change our ways. 
 
We are Connected 
People at TSB are part of dynamic teams, whether they work as colleagues in a Department, 
researchers in an impact team, or lecturers in a curriculum or support the academic staff in performing 
their tasks:  all of their work is connected to other people’s  work. Teams can also include members 
from various Departments who combine disciplinary strengths and expertise to enhance education, 
advance research methodology, or perform theme-based research.  We create our output together 
and we are evaluated as such. We connect with our students, both national and international, to give 
them a platform and to co-create the academic ecosphere at our School. We engage with people from 
other Schools as well, to learn from best research and educational practices and get inspiration from 
different disciplinary perspectives on common themes. We reach out to other academic institutions, 
by means of partnerships and ENGAGE, our European network of universities with whom we 
increasingly collaborate in research and education. We also explicitly connect and develop alliances 
with regional, national, and international stakeholders to formulate common goals and work towards 
achieving durable transitions.  
 
We Care 
TSB cares for its people, whether academic staff, support staff, or students. This means that, in 
everything we do, we have an eye for the human side of academia. We discuss workload and 
experiment with and learn from measures that alleviate work pressure. We apply transparent rules 
for the allocation of resources and work and for the potential for personal development. We also know 
when to deviate from the rules when needed but are always transparent about when and why we do 
so. We hold each other accountable and support one another, especially in situations where people 
are vulnerable. We also care for transparent and high-quality science. We are a trustworthy partner 
because we make sure that our work is sound, and we always take ethical and moral considerations 
into account in all the interactions we have with external stakeholders. Finally, we care for the world 
around us. We study challenges and change with the aim of improving people’s health, well-being, 
resilience, and adaptiveness.   
5 
 3.  Major Developments 
Below we highlight some of the external and internal developments that are key for the choices that 
we want to make for the coming strategy period.  
 
Innovation with(in) the social and behavioral sciences 
As a School, we are constantly challenged and inspired. TSB researchers have been active in cross-
disciplinary theme-based research, such as using insights from developmental psychology and 
geriatric medicine to enhance people’s lifespan perspective, combining psychological and biological 
datasets to improve our understanding of mental problems and assessing the impact of outsourced 
digital labor from both an organizational and individual perspective, to name a few. Another relevant 
development is the increasing importance of integrating the perspectives of citizens, patients, 
employees, and other practitioners into research projects to improve quality of health(care) and work. 
These examples show that the social and behavioral sciences are challenged to innovate themselves 
in terms of questions, methodology, and collaboration with both other disciplines and external 
stakeholders (including citizens).  
 
Digital transformation of society, research, and education 
Digitalization fundamentally changes the way people communicate, work, learn, and participate in 
society. Several of these trends have been addressed by the recent national Knowledge Agenda Online 
Society (2021). Digitalization is also a driver for the development of new digital technologies, such as 
innovative ways to measure, collect, and analyze the ever-increasing quantity of (online) data. Think, 
for example, of using smart sensor technology and advanced software to analyze a higher quality of 
data while, at the same time, reducing the burden on respondents. Regarding our education, the use 
of blended learning holds the promise of enhancing the quality of educational experiences. All these 
developments—new questions, methodology, and technology—require us to assess if our scientists 
and students are sufficiently equipped with the knowledge, skills, and facilities to understand, reflect 
on, and apply digital technologies for research and education.  
 
Role of science contributing to tackling societal problems 
We witness changing expectations of the role of science. Mission-driven research working towards 
solutions to the major societal challenges of our time is becoming more prevalent in government 
policies and external funding programs. Universities are increasingly engaging in the development of 
solutions in (regional) ecosystems with a wide range of non-academic partners to meet common 
challenges and make a demonstrable difference to society through human-centered innovation. New 
types of collaboration, positions, and roles are emerging to effectively connect science and practice. 
Our university is currently initiating several academic collaborative centers aimed at co-creating 
relevant knowledge with external partners. In these centers, the formulation of research problems, 
education challenges, impact ambitions, and the appropriate strategies to realize these take place in 
dialogue with the stakeholders involved. At TSB, contributing to societal impact, based on our own 
disciplinary strengths, is becoming an integral part of the research and education activities within 
teams. 
 
Freedom of choice in education and lifelong development 
The notion has grown that universities need to offer their students more choices. This concerns the 
way in which education is offered by asking ourselves whether we want to organize the didactically 
effective elements of blended learning in a more structural way. However, it also involves offering 
students sufficient freedom of choice both in the Bachelor's phase, with, for example, room to follow 
part of their education in another program at Tilburg University or in a European context, such as 
within the ENGAGE program and in the Master's program portfolio to better meet the needs of 
6 
 prospective students. Tilburg University has also expressed the desire to keep its students involved in 
education by offering them lifelong development (LLD) programs after they graduate. LLD enables 
professionals to update their evidence-based knowledge in a world where new developments and 
insights emerge at an increasing rate.  
 
High work pressure on staff due to increasing enrollment, competition, and compliance 
Nation-wide,  student enrollment in social and behavioral sciences education programs has been 
growing dramatically while government funding for education has not kept pace. Accommodating this 
growth has caused a significant increase in work pressure, which was reinforced in 2020 by the 
measures needed to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many academic staff and especially 
early-career researchers already faced pressure to publish regularly in high-ranked journals and obtain 
grants in a highly competitive environment. At the same time, nation-wide, universities have been 
dealing with increasing requirements by external stakeholders, such as complying with performance 
and quality agreements and data management regulations. By 2021, the need is increasingly felt to 
focus on what is essential for our School and foster a culture that focuses on qualitative growth and 
trust.  
 
Finding a new balance in recognizing and valuing scientists  
Part of the before-mentioned high work pressure was related to the focus in the academic world on 
individual, quantitative output indicators. Furthermore, many academics perceived a one-sided 
emphasis on research excellence, resulting in an under-appreciation of the other key areas, such as 
education, impact, leadership, and team spirit. To address and tackle these persistent issues, several 
initiatives have been taken by organizations such as the VSNU, KNAW, and NWO. More focus on 
quality, content, scientific integrity, contribution to science and/or society has become central to the 
Strategy Evaluation Protocol  (SEP) 2021–2027. Furthermore, the publication of Room for Everyone's 
Talent; Towards a New Balance in the Recognition and Rewards for Academics  (2019) made a powerful 
case for a broader assessment of evaluating the performance of scientists. In the new strategy period, 
the university will further implement and evaluate the Recognition & Rewards ( Erkennen en 
Waarderen ) policy in its HR policies.

 4.  Education 
At TSB, students engage with highly skilled staff in state-of-the art educational programs. Study 
programs at TSB educate competent future leaders and professionals who have a thorough 
understanding of their disciplines and research methodology and have the skills to actively contribute 
to diverse teams. TSB graduates embody the Tilburg University motto of Understanding Society. 
Therefore, students are motivated to develop their knowledge, skills, and character to learn to 
understand how to approach and tackle complex societal issues. Lecturers, aided by support staff, are 
inspired to provide courses that are up to date and match students’ studying capabilities and 
preferences.  
 
Below we specify our main priorities for the coming strategy period. 
 
1) Diversify the School’s educational portfolio 
Developments in our fields of expertise and changing student preferences urge us to diversify our 
educational portfolio, ensure students’ freedom of choice, and improve their available options to 
learn. This is especially relevant given the growing number of Bachelor’s students, who we would like 
to encourage to take their Master’s program in Tilburg. As the relevance of interdisciplinary thinking 
and work has been increasing, we also aim for more interdisciplinary education. We no longer aim for 
quantitative growth in the Bachelor intake unless deemed necessary for the vitality of the 
Department(s) involved. 
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will develop interdisciplinary minors with our European partners in the ENGAGE framework.  
b. We will explore possibilities for developing new, attractive Master’s programs while maintaining 
the viability and relevance of our existing programs. 
 
2) Train student indigital sciences for society 
Digitalization is a huge driver in society.  We aim to teach students to use digital technologies and 
reflect upon digitalization to understand developments in society. Therefore, we will incorporate 
digital skills, such as programming, computational thinking, and access to digital methods to do 
research in our programs. In our curriculum, we will address digitalization in health & well-being, 
adaptive organizations, and society. In this way, we train our students to become thought leaders in 
the area of digitalization of society.  
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will include the topic of digitalization of society in our curricula. 
b. We will explore the possibility of a university-wide minor for students to develop more in-depth 
knowledge of and access to digital methods to do research in the social and behavioral sciences. 
c. We will incorporate digital skills more into our courses. 
d. We consider incorporating the statistical software program R in our statistics education to improve 
programming and computational thinking. 
 
3) Implement blended learning in programs 
Blended learning, which is the integration of various activating learning strategies, both online and 
face-to-face, makes education more attractive and effective from a didactic point of view.  Connecting 
on-campus education with additional online learning tools allows for diversifying education at both 
student and course level, making education more compatible with students’ abilities and desires. We 
aim to apply blended learning to allow for better constructive alignment, accommodating 
8 
 heterogeneity in skills and knowledge of students, student satisfaction and preference, and learning 
outcomes.  
Proposed measures: 
a. We will incorporate blended learning in the curricula of our existing and prospective programs. 
This not only includes Bachelor’s and Master’s programs, but also blended pre-Master’s programs 
to facilitate the transition of students from universities of applied sciences into our Master’s 
programs. 
b. We will support the implementation of blended learning by offering an implementation structure, 
allocating sufficient lecturing and support capacity, and improving facilities for state-of-the-art 
educational innovation.  
 
4) Optimize students’ learning experiences  
In the past years, we have put much effort in increasing student intake into our programs, which 
increased substantially between 2018 and 2021. In the next period, our focus will shift from 
quantitative growth to qualitative growth, in particular to optimize learning experiences and 
safeguard small-scale education, without increasing work pressure on lecturing staff. To achieve these 
goals, we will, at university level, continue to emphasize the importance of the campus and good 
facilities for students and lecturers. 
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will explore possibilities for implementing learning analytics at the level of the curriculum and 
at the level of individual courses. 
b. We will increase lecturing capacity to safeguard small-scale education that is required for personal 
contact and student interaction in blended learning formats.  
 
5) Decrease the administrative burden of quality assurance on lecturing staff  
Quality assurance is important to remain accredited and maintain attractive programs for our 
students. At the same time, we wish to minimize the administrative burden on lecturing staff. 
Therefore, the challenge is how to optimize educational support for students, lecturers, and 
management.  
 
Proposed measures:  
a. We will identify bottlenecks in the administrative tasks of lecturing staff, develop measures to 
decrease this administrative burden, and evaluate whether these measures are effective. These 
measures may include hiring additional administrative staff that supports lecturing staff. 
b. We will ensure efficiency of the documentation of curriculum plans, assessment plans, course 
syllabi, and course information in all our programs. 
 
6) Care for our students’ well-being 
Student well-being can be hampered, amongst other things, by a lack of information, feeling 
disconnected, a lack of social contacts, or low self-awareness. These problems may particularly occur 
in the groups of first-year and international students and can affect their study performance and entry 
into the labor market. We aim to contribute to improving student well-being by better identifying 
problems and facilitating them in their search for information.  
 
Proposed measures:  
a. We will develop and incorporate evidence-based modules in PASS to improve student well-being 
and prevent well-being problems by providing information relevant to living and studying in Tilburg 
and by facilitating social cohesion and establishing friendship relations.  
9 
 b. We will improve the identification of well-being problems and offer interventions concerning 
students’ well-being.  
  
10 
 5.  Research 
As researchers in the social and behavioral sciences, we observe and identify relevant issues in society. 
Our research creates a thorough understanding of the underlying phenomena. Depending on the 
subject, the research may be conducted by a single research group or by a multidisciplinary or 
interdisciplinary team from different research groups. We create an attractive research infrastructure 
through Open Science with a focus on data sharing . We share our research findings with people, 
organizations, and society to create a better overall awareness of these issues and actively seek 
collaboration and co-creation with societal partners to help them solve complex problems. 
 
Below, we specify our main priorities for the coming strategy period. 
 
1) Stimulate interdisciplinary team science based on disciplinary strengths 
Multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research holds the promise of a better understanding of the 
complex, major societal challenges of our time and, in this way, contributes to science and society.  
Therefore, TSB will continue to invest in interdisciplinary research as a key element of the Herbert 
Simon Research Institute (HSRI). We aim to further strengthen team efforts, both within and outside 
the School, in interdisciplinary research that is rooted in the School’s disciplinary strengths. Based 
upon the efforts to create current HSRI cross-cutting themes2 and in line themes from the Sector Plan,3  
we will also strengthen the position and organization of HSRI.  
 
Proposed measures:  
a. We will create a separate structural budget in the School’s budget for investments, appointments, 
and activities that aim to stimulate HSRI research. 
b. We will stimulate internal collaboration among the School’s research groups by conducting a single 
combined research evaluation covering all our Departments. This implies that we will not conduct 
or join (national) research review processes that cover only specific disciplines.  
c. We will set the aims and strategy of HSRI research in line with the requirements of the SEP Protocol. 
We will develop the narrative argument and identify evidence of the scientific achievements for 
HSRI’s scientific relevance, societal relevance, and viability. 
d. We will strengthen interdisciplinary team science and diversify the revenue sources of research 
groups by extending the focus of our incentives and coaching program for grant applications to 
collaborative grants for large consortia, such as within Horizon Europe and the NWO-NWA.  
e. We will improve our external interdisciplinary profile by organizing an annual conference for 
external researchers and other relevant stakeholders at which we can present the connection 
between interdisciplinary and disciplinary research at TSB. 
 
2) Contribute to developing digital sciences for society 
Given the rapid transition towards a digital society, research on the impact of digitalization is both 
urgent and important for our School. The digital society clearly links to TSB’s expert areas, i.e., well-
being, (mental) health, health care, work, and organizations. Together with the other Schools, we 
therefore aim for a prominent role in digital sciences for society. Through research, we will develop 
new insights into and a critical reflection of how digitalization shapes society.  
In addition to our contribution to understanding the digital society, we wish to develop our methods 
regarding digital sciences. We want to help TSB researchers regarding expertise, facilities, and 
 
2  The three current cross-cutting themes of the Herbert Simon Research Institute (HSRI) are: Personalized 
Prevention and Care; Healthy Lifespan; and Adaptive Societies, Organizations, and Workers. 
3 The five themes of the Sector Plan are: Resilience in Youth; Psychological Disorders; The Human Factor in 
New Technologies, Societal Transition and Behavioral Change; and Societal Inequality and Diversity 
(Sectorplan Maatschappij- en Gedragswetenschappen  2020–2025, 2020). 
11 
 assistance needed to use innovative digital technologies and methodological opportunities to 
measure, collect, and analyze data. Therefore, our aim is to enhance the research environment for 
developing, sharing, and applying methods for digital sciences by investing in an infrastructure that 
supports data-intensive research. 
 
a. We will identify and map the relevant digital research methods, experts, and support available or 
missing at TSB. This inventory will also address expertise present elsewhere, e.g., at other Schools, 
LIS, or JADS.  
b. We will focus future calls for HSRI PhD candidates on their contribution to understanding the 
impact of digitalization on individuals, organizations, and society.  
c. We will appoint two academic leads with a track record in digital sciences for social and behavioral 
sciences. Ideally, they have an excellent scientific reputation in both digital methodology or the 
impact of digitalization and at least one application domain at the heart of HSRI.  
d. We will make funds available for methodology fellowship grants (e.g., €50,000) for the 
development and sharing of transdisciplinary data practices in our interdisciplinary HSRI program. 
 
3) Create an environment that promotes open science and team science 
We aim at creating an optimal research environment that offers a broad range of facilities and 
expertise. This research environment will support multiple goals: obtaining research data using either 
traditional or digital technologies; data handling and data analysis using modern methodologies; 
complying with open science requirements, such as data sharing; and promoting and facilitating team 
science. We will develop a joint vision on research infrastructure and make investments that support 
this vision. 
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will further invest in centers of expertise, most notably TESC. These investments include, 
among other things, new research technology. We will organize the centers’ support in such a way 
that the administrative burden for the researchers involved is minimized.  
b. We will expand our current lab facilities, among others, with spaces for data analysis and 
collaborative research in teams. We will expand the support of our lab facilities and stimulate the 
sharing of lab spaces by appointing a lab manager. 
c. We will create a separate structural budget in the School’s budget to make use of existing 
infrastructures for obtaining research data, such as the LISS panel and ODISSEI. 
d. We will improve the infrastructure needed for our Open Science ambitions, such as our wish to 
both make our research material, data, and code openly available as much as possible and promote 
preregistration.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
12 
 6.  Impact 
We create impact in a reiterative process in which disciplinary and interdisciplinary research stimulate 
and enhance each other. In this circular process we actively seek long-term collaboration and co-
creation with societal partners to identify relevant issues in society; share our observations to create 
awareness; offer insights in the underlying phenomena, the relevant context, and the working of 
interventions; and tackle real-world problems and reflect upon profound transitions. We share the 
latest insights from our own research through our Bachelor’s, Master’s, and lifelong development 
programs. 
 
Below we specify our main priorities for the coming strategy period. 
 
1) Develop impact-driven research and education  
Tilburg University is developing towards an open and dynamic innovation hub. At TSB, we already 
have more than twenty years of experience with building bridges between science and practice in the 
Tranzo collaborative centers. And we can expand this further within and outside our own School by 
challenging scientists and students to interact within networks of citizens, professionals, policy 
makers, managers, and entrepreneurs who challenge us to solve their problems and who are willing 
to co-create impact-driven research and education.  
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will lead in the new academic collaborative centers Inclusive Labor Market and Digital Health 
& Innovation.  
b. We will participate in the new academic collaborative centers Broad Prosperity and Climate & 
Energy. 
c. We will develop challenge-based education in which lecturers will guide their students in 
identifying, investigating, and solving real-world challenges.  
 
2) Prepare PhD candidates for a career outside academia 
The changes in the skills required from early career researchers requires us to rethink the PhD 
candidates’ training. Interdisciplinarity, multidisciplinarity, and societal relevance are becoming more 
important in getting early-career funding. Our aim is to also prepare PhD candidates for careers 
outside academia by training them in working in interdisciplinary teams and generating impact.  
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will allow PhD candidates to work during their PhD programs at or together with potential 
employers or organizations involved in the Tilburg University academic collaborative centers. We 
will include supervisors in this process and become proficient in guiding candidates towards a non-
academic position.   
 
3) Explore Lifelong Development education based on own research strengths 
Lifelong Development (LLD) is a means to generate social impact by sharing our observations on 
relevant issues in society, offering insights in the underlying phenomena, the relevant context, and 
the working of interventions. LLD can also help to strengthen our regional and national network of 
partners. We aim to contribute, in the medium term, to the strategic ambition of Tilburg University to 
achieve a recognizable, coherent range of LLD programs. 
Proposed measure: 
13 
 a. We will explore the LLD opportunities for TSB in terms of content, expertise, demand, and viability. 
Starting points: (i) LLD activities are in line with the School’s disciplinary research strengths and 
interdisciplinary themes; (ii) we build from existing networks, which we have already developed 
through our extended Master’s programs, academic collaborative centers, and People 
Management Center; (iii) the university and/or TIAS provides an adequate support structure for 
effectively managing LLD programs; and (iv) we recognize and appreciate TSB scientists who 
provide LLD.   
14 
 7.  People & Organization 
TSB cares for its people, whether academic staff, support staff, or students. We offer a close-knit, yet 
open and inclusive, diverse community where people feel safe, recognized, and valued and can fully 
develop their talents and collaborate with colleagues. Academic staff feel supported by the School’s 
pro-active, transparent, and flexible HR policy, which is based on the MERIT principle that assesses the 
individual’s contribution to the team. People have access to high-quality support and facilities. They 
can meet, work, and study on campus in a healthy, pleasant, and inspiring environment. 
 
Below, we specify our main priorities for the coming strategy period. 
 
1) Reduce work pressure in a sustainable way 
The increase in government funding based on student numbers allows us to substantially expand our 
workforce, and this way reduce workload on average. We need to solve workload issues in a structural 
way as well: “fix things” before getting worse. Therefore, we aim to get a better understanding of 
(perceived) task distribution and execution and take a proactive approach about setting more realistic 
productivity expectations for staff. 
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will establish working arrangements that will help to provide our staff more rest and recovery 
time and a better work-life balance. Examples of such arrangements include no meetings during 
lunch breaks, no mail during weekends, and education-free periods.  
b. We will carefully monitor the hiring process  to guarantee that enough new staff is hired.  
c. We will keep the experienced workload of employees a topic of discussion, focusing both on the 
relationship between manager and employee and relationships within the teams. We will also 
continue to offer coaching on this topic for Heads of Department and managers via the Connected 
Leading program. 
d. We set realistic productivity expectations for staff, for example, in terms of educational quality, 
research output, and impact activities. Therefore, we  will develop and implement a task allocation 
model, that facilitates the allocation of tasks (education, research, impact, governance & 
administration).  
e. We will investigate how we can further relieve academic staff from administrative requirements, 
for example by offering them high-quality and/or more easily accessible support in the 
performance of their tasks (see also Chapter 4). 
f. We will identify risks associated with high work pressure, for example, due to the extra work 
needed to prepare for a course for the first time, and develop relief measures.  
 
 
2) Retain talent by offering scientific staff more diversity in career paths 
In line with the recommendations from the university-wide discussion on Room for Everyone's Talent,  
we will allow faculty to specialize, to some extent, in the contributions they are best able to make 
(research, education, impact, management) while remaining a balanced composition of staff in terms 
of junior/senior and tenured/non-tenured staff. This includes allowing for career paths for assistant 
and associate professors with a focus on education and impact and offering them attractive 
possibilities to develop a career both horizontally and vertically. Specialization decisions, which may 
change over the course of one’s career, are made together with the Head of Department to ensure 
the right balance of composition at the level of the Department.   
 
Proposed measures: 
15 
 a. We will specify the requirements to become assistant professor (UD1) with an education or impact 
profile. 
b. We will specify the requirements to promote assistant professors to become associate professors 
with education or impact profiles. 
c. We will appoint a full professor with an education profile. 
d.  We will aim for long term contracts for lecturers (including research/development time).  
e. We will offer lecturers the possibility to participate in research in education, which will also make 
it possibility to offer a permanent position.   
 
3) Inclusion and social safety 
TSB strives to be an inclusive, diverse4, and safe School in which everyone has the opportunity to thrive 
in research, education, and support and participate fully in decision making. The challenge we face is 
how to translate diversity policy, in the areas of education and research and for staff and students, 
into implementation within the various units. A thorough understanding of exclusion and inclusion at 
our School is required to take an effective, proactive approach about setting expectations for staff and 
students regarding safe learning and working environments.  
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will embed diversity and inclusion of staff and students in existing instruments and policy 
frameworks. 
b. We will facilitate staff and students in guaranteeing social safety by recognizing, discussing, and 
acting upon situations in which social safety is at risk. Thereby, we reflect upon structural and 
cultural factors that can facilitate misconduct within the academic working environment.  
 
4) Stimulate participation in leadership positions 
Heads of Department require excellent leadership and management skills, e.g., to effectively allocate 
tasks and implement Room for Everyone's Talent  policy in their teams. Moreover, the role of Academic 
Director has become increasingly important and complex. To guarantee a sufficiently large pool of 
qualified leaders to fill leadership positions at all levels, we will make serving in leadership positions 
more attractive, for example, by valuing this service when deciding on tenure and promotion and by 
giving a realistic compensation in time for performing management tasks.  
 
Proposed measures: 
a. We will require associate and full professors with an education profile to take on leadership roles, 
such as Academic Director, chair of the Examination Board, chair of the Ethics Review Board, and/or 
Vice-Dean for Education, and value this service when deciding on promotions. 
b. In the exceptional case that an assistant professor takes on a leadership role as Academic Director, 
we will compensate him or her (i.e., scale 13 for the period serving in this role) and value this 
service when deciding on tenure and promotion. 
 
5) Operationalize team science in HR policy 
In our staff evaluations, we want to be better able to consider the value staff members evidently add 
to their team(s). Especially now that interdisciplinary research is becoming more important, the 
“Team” element of MERIT must be broadened so that it not only includes the contribution to the 
Departmental team but to other, interdisciplinary teams as well.  
 
Proposed measure: 
 
4 We refer to diversity in terms of gender and cultural background but also in terms of disability, sexual 
preference, and socio-economic background. 
16 
 a. We will define what we mean by “team”, develop criteria to evaluate the functioning of teams, and 
make sure that the incentives in our internal allocation model are in line with, or at least not in 
conflict with, the strategic choices for team science and Recognition & Rewards.  
 
6) Work effectively together on campus and from home  
Ideally, TSB staff meet, work, and study in an inspiring environment on campus. This is a challenge, 
given the current housing of TSB Departments in separate locations. Moreover, after the COVID-19 
pandemic, there is also a need for hybrid working. While our ultimate aim to accommodate the entire 
School in one single building may not be feasible in the short term, during that time, we want our 
housing strategy to support live interactions and (interdisciplinary) teamwork, e.g., for meetings 
between staff from multiple Departments, including guests from external organizations.  
 
Proposed measures: 
 
a. We will explore establishing sufficient spaces on campus that can be used as collaborative 
workplaces. 
b. We will develop a policy for working from home and invest in facilities for hybrid working.

1.1 Introduction 
The TSB Strategic Plan 2018-2021 is almost at its end. This appendix provides a review of the goals of the 
strategic plan in the five different areas: education, research, impact, and people & organization. In 
education and research major developments were achieved with among others additional educational 
tracks and the founding of the Herbert Simon Research Institute (HSRI). In the impact area more progress 
can be made in the coming strategic period by giving it additional emphasis. Finally on the people & 
organization front the School moves to more professional support with modern takes on diversity. 
 
 
1.2 Education 
The two major, strategic goals in the period were to increase the number of students and to broaden the 
educational profile of the School while maintaining high educational standards. Besides, we wanted to 
further strengthen the internationalization of our education. 
Student inflow 
Inflow in bachelor, premaster, and master programs combined increased from 1,369 students in 2017/18 
to 1,828 in 2020/21, which amounts to an overall increase of 34%. The specific target of 400-500 students 
for the Psychology bachelor was met as well: the inflow more than doubled, before a nationwide Numerus 
Fixus agreement of 600 was put in place as of 2020/21. Table X in the Facts & Figures section displays the 
developments of student inflow, the share of TSB in students at Tilburg University, as well as the market 
share at a national level in comparable fields. 
 
Educational portfolio 
In addition to the already existing English-taught GMSI program, several English-taught tracks were 
introduced within existing programs: 
 The track International Sociology within the Sociology bachelor (2017/18); 
 The track Human Resource Studies: People Management within the Personeelwetenschappen 
bachelor (2018/19) 
 The two tracks Politics, Policy, and Societal Development and Health, Wellbeing, and Society within 
the Sociology master (2018/19); 
2 
  The three tracks Global Management of Social Issues within the masters Organization Studies, 
Sociology, and Human Resource Studies (2018/19); 
 The two tracks Positive Psychology and Well-Being (2019/20) and Cognitive Neuropsychology 
(2020/21) within the master Psychologie en Geestelijke Gezondheid. 
 
Two international double degree programs were initiated: one in Sociology with the University of 
Bamberg in Germany (2017/18) and one in Economic Psychology with SWPS University in Poland 
(2019/20). The Bachelor Program in Sociology was restructured (2018/19) and a second inflow moment 
was created for the Master Human Resource Studies (2018/19). A 30 ECTS-credits premaster Human 
Resource Studies was started (2018/19) as well as an integrated premaster Klinische Kinder- en 
Jeugdpsychologie with the Academische PABO Tilburg (Fontys University of Applied Sciences; 2020/21). 
Possibilities for developing programs on Educational Sciences and on Psychology and Law (together with 
the Tilburg Law School) were extensively explored but turned out not to be viable due to too low projected 
potential student numbers and concerns about institutional embeddedness, respectively. TSB could still 
be involved in an Educational Sciences program developed by the Tilburg School for Humanities and Digital 
Sciences (TSHD). 
 
Quality of education and teaching 
One of the objectives was to enhance the quality of education and the teaching staff by means of teaching 
qualifications. All academic staff need to acquire a University Teaching Qualification (UTQ) within two 
years of their appointment. A full UTQ program is offered to facilitate this. For many years, the percentage 
of academic staff at TSB involved in education holding a UTQ has been around 90%. 
Moreover, incentives have been installed to stimulate the Senior Teaching Qualification (STQ). In the 
previous period, several STQ’s were awarded (Two in 2019). A new, university-wide STQ training program 
has been in effect as of 2020/21. As part of this new program two STQ projects started in 2020 and three 
in 2021. 
 
Internationalization 
All bachelor programs except one now have both an English-language and a Dutch-language track. As a 
consequence, the percentage of international students has doubled from 11.2% in 2016/17 to 22.3% in 
2019/20. Table X in the Facts & Figures section displays the percentage of international students at 
bachelor, premaster and master level. 
   At this moment, all TSB bachelor programs include a mobility window to facilitate students going on 
exchange. However, the percentage of 17.7% of students going on exchange (before the corona 
pandemic) did not yet meet the institutional goal of 25%. 
 
 
1.3 Research 
Broad disciplinary base for excellent research groups 
Our School offers excellent research in all relevant disciplines of the social and behavioral sciences. All TSB 
groups received very high scores in their recent research evaluations (Psychology and Methodology & 
Statistics in 2011-2016 period, and Human Resource Studies, Organization Studies, Sociology, and Tranzo 
covering 2013-2018). As shown by a CWTS analysis of 2019, the output and scientific impact of research 
for TSB -disciplines of methodology and 
as social psychology we have achieved very high impact scores. 
3 
 Encouragement of interdisciplinary research 
TSB has made a start with establishment of an environment that encourages interdisciplinary research 
efforts, but which at the same time preserves the high quality of the disciplinary basis. In 2017, TSB 
decided to invest €4 million in across department collaborative research projects on “Health, Wellbeing, 
and Adaptiveness Studies Using Intensive Data”. To formalize the wish to operate and be perceived as a 
single interdisciplinary unit, in August 2018 we established the Herbert Simon Research Institute (HSRI), 
which bundles all TSB research. While HSRI facilitates the existing research programs of all nine TSB 
departments, to stimulate and profile our cross-departmental collaborative research, we decided to focus 
our investments the next years along three themes: “Adaptive societies, organizations, and workers”, 
“Healthy life span”, and “Personalized prevention and care”. Till now, for these themes nine cross-
departmental PhD projects have been awarded, while also seed money has been made available for data 
collection in smaller projects. 
   The most recent external research evaluation (scope 2013-2018) resulted in praise for the strategy 
underlying HSRI and provided the recommendation to further invest in interdisciplinary research that is 
firmly linked to the disciplinary research of the nine departments. Collaboration could also be 
strengthened with departments at other schools where similar disciplinary research is being conducted. 
In practice, thanks to the incentives of the HSRI, the university Impact program and the We Care program 
with the ETZ, we have already observed a substantial increase in collaborations among (young) 
researchers from different departments in the previous strategy period. 
   Among the initial goals in mind when setting up HRSI was to improve our positioning to obtain large 
consortium grants. However, until now this has not paid off – contrary to individual research grants where 
we have been more successful. 
 
Investments in research infrastructure 
The TSB investments from 2017 not only concerned cross department collaborative research projects, but 
also in new research infrastructure. More specifically, we established the Tilburg Experience Sampling 
Center (TESC) to bundle our expertise in the collection and analysis of intensive longitudinal data, and we 
invested in a new long-term cohort study called the Brabant Study in which families are mothers and their 
children are followed starting from pregnancy. Furthermore, in 2019 the GO-Lab was expanded with a 
third lab room that is fitted with equipment for specific research purposes and increases the capacity of 
the GO-Lab.  
 
Research practices, open science, and data management 
TSB has taken major steps forward in good research practices and open science. The Psychological Ethics 
Committee was reformed to the Ethics Review Board, which ethically reviews research projects of all 
disciplines. Additionally, each project, including student research, is reviewed on data management and 
GDPR requirements. 
   The Science Committee continued its annual audits and the most recent annual audit shows that TSB 
researchers in most cases have excellent data packages available. The percentage of Open Access 
publications increased from 43% in 2017 to 66% in 2020. Numerous staff members became active 
contributors to the Open Science debate, apply pre-registration, and make their data available on forums 
like the Open Science Framework. 
   TSB has also provided an exceptional performance in the area of data management. In doing so, TSB has 
created the basis for an attractive working environment for researchers in which existing data is 
accessible. Examples of shared use of own data can be found at TESC, the Brabant study, and the European 
Values Study. 
 
 
4 
 Improvement of PhD trajectories 
In the past period, the Graduate School has made important steps to improve PhD trajectories. The 
existing monitoring system for internal PhD candidates has been expanded to external PhD candidates, 
the PhD training and supervision plan has been established, a training of PhD supervisors has been set up, 
the requirement of external feedback on PhD chapters as well as a data package had been introduced, 
and much more stringent regulations regarding the composition of PhD committees have been 
established. The PhD education program has been broadened with additional courses on dealing with the 
project management side of pursuing a doctorate. 
 
 
1.4 Impact
In our assessment of the strengths of TSB in the previous period, we find that our research is generally 
highly socially relevant, that “Health & Wellbeing” is still a topical issue, and that our researchers respond 
flexibly to societal developments in this field, as was shown, for example, by the many Covid-19 research 
studies initiated by TSB researchers in 2020. Below we zoom in on two aspects of the impact dimension: 
structural collaborations and the rewarding of impact. 
 
Developing structural cooperation in regional ecosystems 
We note that TSB maintains many productive relationships with its social partners. For over 20 years now, 
Tranzo has co-created with organizations from practice and other (knowledge) institutions in care and 
welfare through its eleven academic collaborative centers (“academische werkplaatsen”). Examples of 
other structural partnerships were present elsewhere in TSB, most notably the People Management 
Center (PMC; Department of Human Resource Studies). At the university level the We Care program was 
initiated with the Elisabeth Tweesteden Hospital (ETZ), for which TSB provided the Impact lead and in 
which by now many TSB researchers are active . 
   At the same time, not all opportunities for strategic collaboration with partners have been exploited. 
Think for instance of connecting the international partners of our School with regional ecosystems. The 
European ENGAGE framework can provide opportunities in this regard. The concept of the PMC could also 
be applied in departments that already have many relationships with (regional) business. And in a number 
of areas covered by Tranzo there is an overlap in terms of content with other departments, and 
researchers from different disciplines can make useful joint contributions to knowledge development for 
social problems. Finally, there is untapped potential in the structural collaboration, besides the ETZ, with 
other STZ hospitals (Samenwerkende Topklinische Ziekenhuizen), certainly in our own region. 
   At a more fundamental level we lack a system vision of the value, organization and practicalities of 
ecosystems. We still think too much in terms of linear knowledge development in small, “private” 
partnerships. But in order to create substantial social impact, we will have to become more active in 
ecosystems in which a variety of complementary partners cooperate over a longer period of time and 
engage in productive interactions. This includes identifying and removing (administrative) barriers that 
hinder the establishment and management of partnerships. Being part of such ecosystems is not limited 
to research activities but should also be open to education. 
 
Rewarding social impact at the team level 
In the past strategy period, it has become clear that impact as an activity of academic staff is not always 
sufficiently valued. 
   The external research evaluation committee suggested in 2020 to have us reflect on the tension 
between the two missions guiding Tilburg University: "Understanding society", which is geared towards 
realizing a more traditional agenda of fundamental research, and "Advancing society", which has the 
5 
 ambition to increase the societal impact of its research endeavors. Indeed, there seems to be the lack of 
a broadly supported vision on the importance of impact in addition to that of fundamental research. This 
means that we will have to develop or, if it already exists, adopt, a clear definition of impact. 
1.5 People & Organization 
Tenure and promotion policy for academic staff 
In the previous strategy we aimed to move towards a tenure track system and promotion policy in which–
according to the MERIT model–quality is key. In practice, we observe is a need for more transparency in 
the School regarding the criteria for tenure, as the emphasis in applying these criteria is still very much on 
research excellence. Also, we see that the tenure track policy has been expanded to include a route to 
associate professorships, but this has not been done in a uniform way. 
   Regarding the MERIT policy itself, formally the policy still assumes that someone must be excellent on 
all elements. In practice this is not always the case, and the emphasis is mainly on excellence in research 
and (to a lesser extent) in education. There is discussion about the valuation of the various elements 
(especially impact and management). 
   The strategy also stated that we wanted to move towards a personnel policy in which we only wanted 
to hire lecturers and researchers (i.e., UFO categories) on a temporary basis. In practice, this proved 
difficult to bring into practice. Indeed, working with temporary contracts has disadvantages, as it prevents 
departments from retaining good people while they must constantly re-train staff as well. As a result, TSB 
has hired more researchers (Tranzo) and teachers on a permanent basis. 
 
Creating room for diversity 
Positive steps have been made in the diversity policy, and more specifically gender. In the Philip Eijlander 
Diversity Program four vacancies for female senior scientists have been created at our School. Moreover, 
we have strived for equal representation in committees and (management) positions in terms of gender 
and nationality. When filling in vacant chairs, the emphasis has been on female and international 
candidates for the longlist. We have also looked into equality and transparency in rewarding and 
intervened when people were in a disadvantage position due to their gender. Gender and diversity policy 
has been explicitly on the agenda of personnel meetings with the Heads of Department. 
   Many academic staff have participated in training courses that (also) address diversity, such as the 
training Cross-cultural competencies and intercultural communication, the Career Strategy Program, and 
Connected Leading training courses. HR advisors apply the knowledge from the Recruitment Process 
Design and Gender & Diversity Expert trainings. 
 
Culture of cooperation among responsible professionals 
We have seen in the past period that team contributions and management tasks are explicitly being 
addressed in the recruitment, assessment, and development of employees. However, in the perception 
of many, management and team tasks are still undervalued in practice. Attention is paid to this via the 
Connected Leading program. 
 
Adjustment of the financial allocation model 
The internal financial allocation model was evaluated and adjusted in 2018, following a review of the 
university allocation model. Greater weight was given to education parameters and the individual 
research grants compartment was eliminated. 
 
  
6 
 Efficient and effective support services 
A few years prior the start of the previous strategy period the entire support of Tilburg University was 
restructured (the “BEST” program). Concentrating support services at university level has helped to 
harmonize processes and improve the quality of services offered to employees and students. Still, many 
opportunities to further optimize support services exist, for instance by improving coordination in support 
chains. Digitalization of services has also led to employees having to do more themselves. 
 
Accommodation at different locations 
Ideally, TSB aims to accommodate the entire School in one single building. The move of the departments 
of Medical and Clinical Psychology (from TIAS to Simon Building) and Methodology & Statistics (from 
Simon to Reitse Poort) was scheduled for the summer of 2021 but has been postponed to January 2022. 
The GO-lab will remain in the TIAS building. The relocation of the LifeSpan lab (from Simon Building to 
TIAS, located next to the GOlab) can be realized in the summer of 2021. The lab facilities are still organized 
by departments themselves.
