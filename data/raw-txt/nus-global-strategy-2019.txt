NUS GLOBAL STRATEGY02
NUS - A GREAT GLOBAL
UNIVERSITY
NUS has grown from strength to strength, and is now a top-ranked research and
entrepreneurship-focused, global university. The University has achieved this stature,
due in part to its strong focus on internationalisation, which has resulted in several
innovations in global education. These include the NUS Overseas Colleges, Yale-NUS
College, Study Trips for Engagement and EnRichment (STEER) and one of the largest
Student Exchange Programmes (SEP) in any university today.
 
The vision of NUS is to be a leading global university shaping the future. NUS aspires to
be a vital community of academics, researchers, staff, students and alumni working
together in a spirit of innovation and enterprise for a better world.  Our singular focus
on talent will be the cornerstone of a truly great university that is dedicated to quality
education, influential research and visionary enterprise, in service of country and
society.

 POSITION NUS AT THE
FOREFRONT OF

possible student participation in
Study Abroad Programmes (SAP) for
every student cohort. 
 
There is evidence that a study
abroad experience develops
interpersonal skills, trans-national
competencies and cultural
intelligence, as well as improves
employment prospects and
outcomes. 
 
 A study abroad experience will
become an integral part of the
undergraduate experience.
Students may choose from an
experiential entrepreneurship
programme - the NUS Overseas
College, Student Exchange
Programme, short-term
summer/winter programmes or
overseas internships.
2. LEADING THE WAY IN
INNOVATION AND
GROWTH FOR THE REGION
NUS will develop more capability building programmes
in Southeast Asia, and establish the University as an
innovation and enterprise hub in the region
NUS GLOBAL STRATEGY
05
NUS will do its part to grow and nurture regional talent, thereby
creating a network of talented communities in Southeast Asia
(SEA). It seeks to serve as a hub for innovation and enterprise,
thereby enabling of the growth of SEA.
 
NUS will engage universities in SEA to work towards excellence
in education, research and innovation. We will continue to be
actively involved in the ASEAN University Network Quality
Assurance (AUN-QA) network, lead the Programme for
Leadership in University Management (PLUM), as well as other
capability-building programmes for university leaders in Asia.
These efforts will help elevate the standards of universities in
Asia, as well as enable NUS to serve as a provider of thought
leadership in higher education.
 
NUS will also develop new programmes in partnership with top
universities in the SEA region, by leveraging on NUS' experience
and networks. 
 
With the aim of building a wider innovation and
entrepreneurship (I&E) eco-system in Southeast Asia, NUS will
strengthen relations with partner universities to train relevant
staff in I&E; increase the  intake of students from Asian
universities into NUS' Summer Programme on Entrepreneurship;
expand the NUS Overseas College (NOC) Southeast Asia; and
grow the BLOCK71 network in SEA.

3. DEVELOPING
INTELLECTUAL LEADERSHIP
IN GLOBAL EDUCATION 
Not only is it desirable to have maximum
participation in SAP by students in every
cohort, it is also important that the study
abroad experience achieves positive
impact in the lives of our students.
 
NUS endeavours to extend the
intellectual understanding on the impact
and benefits of study abroad
programmes through data-driven and
evidence based studies. 
 NUS has undertaken an initial study to
analyse the impact of NUS’ study abroad
programmes on student employment
outcomes. 
 
The University will actively explore a wide
range of studies to examine the impact
of SAP from various aspects, especially in
soft skills and competencies required to
thrive in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
