  The University is at  
a critical juncture  
To thrive in the 21st century knowledge economy, we must 
position ourselves to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities that will arise over the next decade. 
To respond to these imperatives, I asked our community   
to help us imagine 2030. T ogether we gathered invaluable  
insights and identified catalytic ideas to guide us through  the coming years. 
Transformation 2030 is our own coming-of-age story.   
It is our p ath to greater resilience, enabling us to fulfill  
our collective potential as we respond with integrity and  creativity to the demands of our rapidly changing world.

PROCESS TRANSFORMATION 2030 
To achieve their dreams 
and aspirations, people and organizations need to plan and map out the road to their future. With this in mind, the University 
launched an innovative strategic planning exercise, designed to obtain maximum engagement and input. 
Throughout this process, we called on 
the cr
eativity of the University community 
– students, faculty members, staff, alumni, donor
s and key stakeholders – to participate 
in co-creating a new vision for our future.

CORE  
ASPIRATIONS 
The connective tissue of our strategic plan 
During Phase 1 of our process, the uOttawa community collectively 
laid the foundation for Transformation 2030 by identifying and validating 6 core aspirations that inform everything we do. 
TRANSFORMATIVE  
LEARNING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH 
We are very conscious of the need to prepare  
our students, whatever their field of study. We  will favour inclusive, innovative, and nimble  teaching, both disciplinary and interdisciplinary,  nourished by best practices in pedagogy. We will conduct cutting-edge, high-quality disciplinary and interdisciplinary research, in which the intellectual worth of basic research and practical application are both valued and celebrated.

VIBRANT FRANCO -
ONTARIAN AND 
FRANCO-CANADIAN 
CULTURE 
We consider our commitments to Franco-Ontarian 
and Franco-Canadian culture to be elemental, and we wish to play a frontline role in the broader intercultural French-speaking world. 
EFFECTIVE 
GOVERNANCE 
We will govern ourselves with rigour and 
transparency, focusing on the quality and value of administrative services from the user’s point of view. OUTSTANDING 
LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT 
We wish to remain an employer of choice and 
are highly attuned to the fact that our success is built on the contributions of our talented and dedicated staff, both academic or non-academic. 
SUSTAINED 
COMMITMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY 
We will demonstrate a strong commitment 
to our community, in our respect for its values as much as in our generous sharing of the fruits of our activity.

AGILE 
Succeeding in a world where  
change is the only constant TRANSFORMATION 2030 
In this digitally driven 
era of ceaseless change, our diligent stewardship of the wisdom of the past must not distract us from the urgency of present and future imperatives. Twenty-first century learners cannot be  
expected to approach uOttawa in the ways  
that nineteenth or twentieth century learners  
did, nor will they tolerate outdated academic  
offerings or inflexible learning technologies. 
Our students and and faculty members – those 
of today and of t
omorrow – demand that we be 
nimble, and that we seize every new opportunity to create, share and discover knowledge, proactively exploring new pedagogies and learning platforms as they emerge. 
Consequently, developing an institutional  
culture and t
oolset to enable rapid, responsive,  
practical and flexible iteration is critical to 
ensuring uOttawa’s continued relevance  and excellence in the decade to come.

As academics, we are both 
in the world and of it, and today that world is becoming ever more densely tangled and interconnected. 
In truth, the ivory tower was always more 
metaphor than reality, but we can no longer maintain even the illusion of the university as an aloof and privileged sanctuary. 
Our successes as collaborative researchers, as 
educat
ors of skilled professionals and creative 
thinkers, as a destination for the best students and the best faculty, as well as our ability to attract results-based funding, are largely dependent upon the quality and character of our connections with the world around us. The University of Ottawa enthusiastically embraces this highly ne
tworked future and 
commits to deepening and expanding its connections nationally and internationally to ferry resources, expertise and opportunities to and from uOttawa. We also commit to enriching local connections, notably by strengthening existing relationships with the Franco-Ontarian and Algonquin Anishnaabe communities, as well as with Canada’s preeminent technology cluster in Kanata North and with ministries and agencies of the federal government headquartered in Ottawa.

IMPACTFUL 
TRANSFORMATION 2030 
Working together to build 
a better world 
In the world’s great 
universities, students, faculty, and staff are driven by a burning desire 
to make a difference. They hunger to tackle big problems,   
to disrupt, and to shape transformative  solutions to real-world issues.  
At uOttawa we share that ambition. Many of our faculty members and alumni have already made a substantial and lasting impact, and we will nurture and intensify this urgent sense of purpose, making it an indispensable element of uOttawa’s culture. 
Over the next decade we will increase our impact. By 2030 we will matter more to more people, be more valued by more partners, and be recognized for our commitment to making the greatest positive impact that we can on behalf of the people and communities we serve.

SUSTAINABLE 
TRANSFORMATION 2030 
Securing our shared future 
Whether we limit our 
definition of sustainability to the environmental realm, or expand it to include sustained financial viability in an era of uncertain public funding, or the sustainability of our buildings, or personal and community well-being as we grapple with the stresses of university life, our conclusion must always be the same: sustainability is non-negotiable. Our future literally depends on our 
ability to design, implement and promote sustainable practices for our planet, for ourselves and for our bottom line. We will rise to meet that challenge in every domain of our activity and will spur ourselves to ensure that we work to bring about change, not only on campus, but also beyond it.

Connectivi-T , a work by artist Hélène Rochette, is an impressive sculpture 
weighing over 1200 kg and measuring 25 meters tall. Installed in the Learning Crossroads, it features a jumble of aluminium tubes to which coloured rings are attached. The fluid curves and rings combine to form an organic, aerial structure that evokes the dynamic discussions and interrelated discoveries that occur at the University of Ottawa.
