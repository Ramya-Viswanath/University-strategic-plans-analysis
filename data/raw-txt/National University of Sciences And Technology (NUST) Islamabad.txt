It is my pleasure to present the Strategic Plan 2019-2023 of the National University 
of Science and Technology (NUST), which is the foundation for living our vision, 
mission and values as spelt out in this document. Our value statements are very 
important to us as an institution. We fully understand that we must live these values to 
realise our vision and future.
The NUST Strategic Plan is based on five key Strategic Directions (Key Result Areas), 
namely: Infrastructure Development; Business Development; Technology, Innovation 
and Intellectual Property; Research, Teaching and Learning and Community Scholarly 
Engagement and Organisational Effectiveness.  These five Strategic Directions will 
support our ambition and they will be supported by specific Goals, Strategic Objectives and 
Strategic Actions. The Strategic Goals and Objectives set out in the Plan are underpinned by 
national policy initiatives and the parent Ministry’s Strategic Plan 2019-2023.
The NUST Strategic Plan 2019-2023 plots a new trajectory for the University in securing 
and advancing the University’s position within the higher and tertiary education landscape 
in Zimbabwe. In crafting this plan, we have reflected on the achievements and challenges of 
the past as we now look forward to a brighter future.
The crafting of this Plan has been an all-inclusive team process involving all levels of 
employees, students and Council. As such, the NUST Council will ensure that the University 
is managed in a sound manner that fosters efficient and effective academic and management 
accountability within an environment characterised by good corporate governance. 
The Council will supervise the business and affairs of the University to foster long-term 
success and to maximize shareholder value in a manner that recognises the interests of all 
stakeholders identified in the Plan’s Stakeholder Analysis.
Finally, I would like to extend my profound and warm gratitude to the government, our 
parent Ministry, my colleagues in the NUST Council, the University management, staff and 
students, stakeholders and partners, employers and the wider community for their valuable 
contributions to the University in the past and in the future. May the spirit of teamwork and 
cooperation continue as the University embarks on its transformational path as set out in this 
Strategic Plan.
Thank you

1.0 INTRODUCTION
This document sets out the Strategic Plan for the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) for the period 
2019-2023.  In developing the document, the University took into cognisance changes in the general environment 
and the current state of Higher Education as stipulated in the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and 
Technology Development’s (MHTESTD) Strategic Plan, 2019-2023. The Ministry’s plan clearly shows the shift from 
Education 3.0, which emphasised teaching, research and community engagement, to Education 5.0, which now also 
emphasizes innovation and industrialisation.
The Strategic Plan defines ‘who we are, where we are going, how we hope to get there and how we will know when we are there,’ in 
line with the Ministry’s Strategic Plan. It has been developed against the backdrop of government initiatives, such as the Transitional 
Stabilization Programme (TSP), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Education 5.0. These initiatives will provide 
significant opportunities to be exploited and challenges to be addressed by NUST .
The Plan outlines five Key Strategic Directions that NUST will concentrate on in the next five years, namely: 
1.  Infrastructure Development, 
2.  Business Development, 
3.  Innovation and Intellectual Property, 
4.  Research, Teaching and Learning, and Community Scholarly Engagement and 
5. Organisational Effectiveness. 
These five directions are derived from the aspirations of the Ministry, Sustainable Development Goals and National Skills Imperatives 
as encapsulated in the results of the 2018 National Skills Audit.  Like all Strategic Plans, this document also specifies the University's 
strategic goals, objectives, responsibilities, resources, key performance indicators and time frames within which results must be 
achieved.
For the purposes of monitoring and evaluation, the Operational Plans of this Strategic Plan shall be reviewed quarterly, and the 
Strategy itself, annually.  The Plan covers the following sections:
(i) The context provides the overview of the external and internal environments within which NUST operates,
(ii) The approach used in developing the Strategic Plan,
(iii) The Vision, Mission and Value Statements,
(iv) The Key Strategic Directions, Goals and Objectives (with tables for each) outlining the strategies,   
 targets (timelines) and resources, and
(v)  The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan.
This Strategic Plan will guide and focus the attention and efforts of all stakeholders towards the realisation of the NUST mandate, 
which is to develop human capital with a bias towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines. 
The Strategic Plan was developed through a series of workshops that involved Councillors, Senior Managers, Heads of Departments 
as well as different Departmental representatives. Facilitated by members of the University community and an external consultant, 
the aim of the workshops was to foster a complete understanding of the envisaged University plan that is aligned to the Ministry’s 
own Strategic Plan 2019-2023 for the modernisation and industrialisation of Zimbabwe through  relevant education that is able to 
provide goods and services. The participants at these workshops were also expected to cascade the planning process to the lowest 
levels of the University community, thus facilitating an across-the-board buy-in for effective implementation. 
2.0 VISION, MISSION AND V ALUE STATEMENTS
This section was developed with hindsight of the Vision, Mission and Value Statements of the MHTESTD as well as the University 
mandate. Contributing to ‘a heritage-based Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development for a competitive 
industrialised and modernised Zimbabwe by 2030’, the University will be guided by the following Vision, Mission, Value Statements 
and Motto.
2.1 VISION
To be a world class University in science, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship and business development, spearheading 
industrialisation locally and beyond.
2.2 MISSION
To lead in human capital development for industrial and socio-economic transformation, with a bias towards science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics (STEM) based solutions.
2.3 V ALUE STATEMENTS
2.3.1 In the delivery of value to our clients, we pursue academic excellence with integrity, honesty and ethical behaviour.
2.3.2 We are committed to responsible research and innovation that drives commercialisation and industrialisation.NUST STRATEGIC PLAN 2019-2023

2.3.3 We thrive on mutual respect, teamwork and effective partnerships.
2.3.4 We are driven by a passion to fulfil your dream.
2.4 MOTTO
Think in Other Terms
3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL/EXTERNAL ANALYSIS (PESTLEE)
There is a mismatch in higher education in Zimbabwe, characterised by high literacy levels (96%) and very low skills levels (38%), 
with business and commerce exhibiting a skills surplus of 121%. As a University, NUST is challenged to contribute towards a 
reduction in the 58% gap between the literacy and skills levels. In addition, Zimbabwean universities are characterised by low 
international rankings and NUST, through this Strategic Plan, seeks to improve its ranking. 
An analysis of the macro environmental forces that could impact on NUST’s strategic initiatives and operational plans was 
undertaken using Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental and Ethical (PESTLEE)factors. There was a 
thorough assessment of the country’s macro-economic, socio-cultural, political, technological, legal, ethical and environmental 
factors and their effect on NUST now and in the foreseeable future. These factors will affect the University’s attempt to develop and 
deliver a knowledgeable and skilled human capital base for the production of quality goods and services as outlined in the Mission 
of the parent Ministry. A summary of the PESTLEE analysis is presented in Table 1.
Table 1: PESTLEE Analysis
NUST STRATEGIC PLAN 2019-2023

NUST STRATEGIC PLAN 2019-2023

Each factor in Table 1 is analysed in terms of whether it is an opportunity or a threat to NUST and its impact on the University is 
rated as high, medium or low. A consideration is also made on whether the factor is in the short, medium or long-term plan. The 
majority of the factors identified were threats rated in the high category, indicating that the macro-environment provides strong 
challenges for NUST. In this regard, the University will contribute towards ensuring an affordable, competitive and accessible 
education: thereby helping raise employment levels and reducing poverty.
4.0 STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS
The planning process included a stakeholder analysis to identify key stakeholders that are of importance to NUST and the impact 
that these stakeholders have on the University’s ability to achieve its vision, mission and objectives. The analysis looked at the needs 
of the stakeholders as compared to the needs of the University, the ability of the stakeholders to block the University’s efforts and 
the level of power held by each stakeholder. Table 2 shows the results of the stakeholder analysis.

5.0 INTERNAL ANALYSIS
An internal analysis aims to identify internal strategic factors which are commonly referred to as organisational strengths and 
weaknesses by assessing the internal engines driving the University. The McKinsey 7-S Framework and the resource appraisal 
techniques can be combined to form the basis of the analysis. Figure 1 illustrates the McKinsey Framework and the elements that 
form the basis for an internal analysis of the University. 
Figure 1:  McKinsey 7-S Framework: Source: McKinsey Quarterly, 2008
Using the above framework as the basis of the University’s internal analysis, a number of issues and possible 
actions were identified as shown in Table 3.
Table 3: NUST Internal Analysis Summary

6.0 SWOT ANALYSIS
The internal and external analyses conducted above culminated in a SWOT analysis. SWOT is an acronym that stands for Strengths 
and Weaknesses (as internal strategic factors) and Opportunities and Threats (as external strategic factors). The SWOT analysis 
was undertaken not only to identify NUST’s distinctive competencies, the particular capabilities and resources it possesses, and the 
superior way in which they are used, but also to identify opportunities that the University is not currently able to take advantage of 
due to the prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The results of the SWOT Analysis are shown in Table 4 where each SWOT factor 
is rated in terms of its importance or impact as major, moderate  or minor.NUST STRATEGIC PLAN 2019-2023

7.0 GROWTH STRATEGIES
In weighing the strategic options available, the University decided to adopt a growth strategy driven by the Ansoff’s Product Matrix 
Expansion Grid as well as the Blue Ocean approach. This growth will involve an increase in the students’ population through the 
identification of new markets and development of new programmes in the Faculties, from the current 10706 to 21000 by 2023. New 
business development projects will also be established through diversification. Through the Ansoff’s matrix and the Blue Ocean 
strategy approach, the University identified areas that needed to be streamlined and improved on as indicated in Tables 5 and 6.
7.1 Current market and products
The University currently draws 99% of its students from Zimbabwe, with the remainder coming from the rest of the continent. 
Within Zimbabwe the University is currently focusing on the cities of Bulawayo and Harare. The current mode of delivery for most 
post-graduate programmes is evening, fulltime and block release. At present the University offers a wide range of undergraduate 
and postgraduate programmes across its seven faculties as shown in Appendix 1 . As part of its growth strategy the University will 
introduce additional programmes.Presently the University is receiving applications in the region of 6000, yet capacity is limited to 
admission of only 2000 new students per year.NUST STRATEGIC PLAN 2019-2023

Table 5: The NUST Growth Matrix8.0 THE FIVE KEY STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS
The University’s Strategic Directions were formulated in light of the prevailing socio-economic and political environment, the SWOT 
analysis and the Ministry’s strategic goals. The five strategic directions are: infrastructure development; business development; 
innovation and intellectual property; research, teaching and learning and community scholarly engagement support as well as 
organisational effectiveness. Each of the Strategic Directions will be accompanied by a number of strategic initiatives that will be 
developed at Faculty and Departmental level.
The Ministry’s 5 strategic goals are (MG1) - a higher education system that provides goods and services; (MG2) - strong educational 
programmes supported by modern physical and financial infrastructure; (MG3) - heritage-based higher and tertiary education science 
and technology development, that provides quality goods and services; (MG4) industrialised economy that provides quality goods 
and services and (MG5) robust governance structures for the modernisation and industrialisation of Zimbabwe. These are captured 
in each of  NUST’s five Strategic Directions as shown in Table 7.
