 UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH  
From Idea to Impact  | Summary  
STRATEGIC RESEARCH PLAN 2023 –2028  
 
Objectives : Research principles and g oals 
The University of Guelph's Strategic Research Plan (SRP) is driven by five research principles and goals: 
Elevate Excellence, Promote Partnership, Increase Impact, Develop the Research Leaders of Tomorrow, 
and Embed Research in All We Do. The plan is guided by the university's mission to improve life, and 
success in achieving these goals will be assessed throu gh relevant key performance indicators (KPIs).  
1. Elevate Excellence. The university aims to be ranked among the top 10 Canadian research -
intensive universities and have several disciplines ranked among the top globally. This will be 
achieved by nurturing gro und-breaking research initiatives, pursuing new and emerging areas of 
scholarship, and ensuring research impact. KPIs include scholarly achievements, recognition of leaders, research funding, research intensity, and internal and external Indigenization, equity, 
diversity, and inclusion (IEDI)  measures, among others. 
2. Promote Partnership.  The university aims to be a globally recognized Canadian research partner 
of choice for industry, government, Indigenous Peoples, and not -for-profit organizations. We 
will c atalyze, create, and steward productive strategic academic, public -sector, and private -
sector research partnerships. KPIs for this principle include research outputs with partners, number and value of research partnership agreements, diversity of partners,  and leveraging 
partnerships toward externally funded grants.  
3. Increase Impact. The university aims to be a global leader in knowledge mobilization by 
increasing engagement with communities, industry, Indigenous governments, policymakers, and not-for-profit  partners. To do so, the university will mobilize our research discoveries to 
maximize their benefit for communities for external and non -academic communities. KPIs 
include volume and reach of knowledge translation and transfer activities, influence on pub lic 
policy and industry practices, intellectual property disclosures and licensing agreements, and open -access research article publications.  
4. Develop the Research Leaders of Tomorrow. The university will increase its capacity to support 
the next generation of research leaders by providing high -quality training opportunities to a 
diverse and inclusive population of researchers, including students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career researchers. KPIs for this principle include research-focused s tudent supervision, 
IEDI in the University research community, industry supported placements, scholarships and 
fellowships, and early researcher awards.  
5. Embed Research in All We Do. The university will demonstrate leadership as an evidence -driven 
instituti on by embedding research outputs and expertise in all activities, including teaching, 
research support, administration, governance, and community engagement. KPIs for this principle include use of research in decision -making and policy development, researc h-
measured effects of decisions and policies, transfer of research knowledge in the classroom, and undergraduate research opportunities.

 Priority areas  for research and research training : Disciplines and themes  
The research disciplines in which we excel are:  
A. Arts , Humanities,  and Social  Science s research  extends from artistic, creative, and critical 
practice  across the breadth of the liberal arts, to the exami nation of  families, communities, 
economies, geographies, and societies to improve the health and well-being of families and 
society .  
B. Science,  Technology,  Engineering,  and Mathematics  research  at the University  of Guelph  
encompasses  both  curiosity -driven exploration  of the properties  of the universe and living  
systems and the application of newly  discovered knowledge  to real-world  problems.   
C. Agriculture  and the related bio -economy is an area of research specially embedded in the 1964 
University of Guelph Act . Built  on this foundation, the University of Guelph has been ranked 
globally for its impact on agricultural sciences and  is a leader in research in every part of the 
food value chain, including food science and food safety .  
D. Veterinary  Medicin e research at the University of Guelph is founded on the great strengths of 
the Ontario Veterinary College . The University of Guelph is a leader in veterinary medicine , 
cover ing the continuum from molecular and cellular processes to whole animal health and 
welfare to popula tion medicine, with unique strengths in comparative medicine . 
E. Business research at the University of Guelph addresses critical problems affecting consumers, 
employees, employers, organizations, industries, markets, economies, societies, and , indeed , 
the e ntire planet. Advancing business as a force for good, the University leads  the shift to 
more ethical  and responsible use of resources.  
 
The themes  that connect our research are:  
1. Fundamental: Discovery  University of Guelph’s fundamental research builds an understanding 
of the continuum between curiosity -driven, discovery-based exploration of the properties of the 
universe and living systems on the one hand and the application of that knowledge and wisdom 
to real -world problems on the other.  
2. Applied: Innovation and Creation  University of Guelph researchers are solving problems 
through the production and analysis of novel innovations, be they technological or cultural 
forms, and in doing so , expand the bou ndaries of practice -based research. The University of 
Guelph has a deep history and prominent expertise in community -engaged research, including 
an extensive focus on Ontario’s rural communities. Community -engaged scholarship allows 
researchers to collabor ate with local and global populations using scholarly approaches and 
evidence to address the challenges and opportunities they identify . 
3. Food  Food research at the University of Guelph extends from the fundamental chemistry of 
foodstuffs to the private and public decisions that impact food production, food safety, food 
distribution, and the business of food , and ultimately , to the impact of food production on 
ecosystems, the economy, and society . Sustainable food systems and challenges relating to food 
security and food safety are strategic areas of emphasis.  
4. One Health  One Health is an interdisciplinary framework focused on the complex 
interconnectedness between human, animal, and environmental health and welfare. Within 
One Health, the University of Gu elph researchers work across disciplines and sectors to 
3 
 interrogate the biological and social factors that impinge on the health of organisms, from the 
level of molecules to that of ecosystems, with unique strengths in comparative medicine.  
5. The Environment  Research into biodiversity, ecology, and the environment are core areas of 
distinction for the University of Guelph, where we target our efforts at addressing UN 
Sustainable Development Goals . The University places particular emphasis on soil, water, and air 
quality, providing a strong foundation for their preservation and wise, sustainable management.  
 
Gender representation in Canada Research Chairs nominations  
The University is currently meeting its 2029 equity targets in all categories, including women and gender minorities.  Progress against targets is monitored using the CRC equity data (see the University’s 
Public 
Accountability and Transparency page ) and reported annually. Institutional actions that support diverse 
representation in CRC nominations  are outlined in the University’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) 
Action Plan . 
 
Areas of research in which the university intend s to deploy Chairs and/or  CFI support 
The matrix is a tool for informed and strategic decision-making that bolsters intersections of critical mass, elevates emerging areas of expertise, energizes untapped opportunities, and shapes our research 
story.

The matrix will be used to assess priority targets  for CRC and CFI investments:   
1. CRC allocation: The matrix will help  to identify priority areas for investment in CRCs based on 
the intersection of Thematic Areas of Focus and Disciplinary Strengths. For example,  a priority 
area for investment in CRCs is identified when  the intersection of a row (Thematic Area of 
Focus) an d a column (Disciplinary Strength) shows a strong research capacity and potential for 
4 
 impact. Using this approach ensures that CRC investments are aligned with both strategic 
research priorities and existing research strengths.  
2. CFI funding : The matrix will also help  guide decisions around the allocation of funding for 
research infrastructure supported by the CFI. By identifying priority areas for investment in 
research infrastructure based on the intersection of Thematic Areas of Focus and Disciplinary 
Strengths, the University can ensure that CFI funding is used in a strategic and effective manner. 
For example, if a particular research area has strong disciplinary strengths but lacks the necessary infrastructure to support research excellence, this becomes  a priority area for 
investment in research infrastructure.  
Efforts and plans for  research and research training  
A discipline -themes matrix has been developed to  inform decision-making to bolster intersections of 
critical mass, elevate emerging areas of expertise, and energize untapped opportunities . A completed 
matrix (see “Canada Research Chairs” above) provides a high -level view of how research expertise is 
distributed at any level, fro m department to research centre to College to the University as a whole. The 
matrix  locates our strengths and gaps, identifying priority areas where initiatives, interventions, and 
investment — like new infrastructure, Canada Research Chairs, revamped poli cies, commercialization 
opportunities, knowledge mobilization — could be directed to strengthen and advance our research 
enterprise, to embed research in everything we do.  
 
Assessment of  success in meeting o bjectives  
The University will use the key perfor mance indicators to set milestones for assessing our progress 
toward our reach goals. Dashboarding our progress at key junctures will provide opportunities to reflect on what we have achieved and what more we aim to accomplish.  
 
Planning and a llocation  
The Provost & VPA and the VPR, in consultation with the Dean(s), will make the decision to allocate a 
vacant CRC. The Provost and VPR may employ any of the following approaches to allocating CRCs:  
Open call for allocation proposals from colleges  
• Thematic call for allocation proposals from colleges (i.e., the call is focused on an identified 
strategic research theme)  
• Direct allocation to colleges without a competition  
• A special call for self -nomination from members of equity -seeking groups  
 
The Pro vost and VPR will then make strategic allocation decisions based on the following principles:  
• Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)  
• Alignment with the themes and disciplines of the Strategic Research Plan  
• Alignment with the principles of the Strategic Res earch Plan
