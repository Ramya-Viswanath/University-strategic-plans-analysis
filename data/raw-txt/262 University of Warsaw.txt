The University of Warsaw Strategy 
for 2023–2032
Strategic development of the University of Warsaw, due to the 
complexity and scale of operations of such a large university, 
as well as the dynamics of change in today’s world and the outside 
world, requires a vision of a university that is innovative, ambitious, 
striving for excellence, open to change and dialogue, as well as 
promoting attitudes of responsibility and commitment. 
In order to achieve this over the period of the next 10 years, 
the UW plans to strengthen capacity building in the area of 
comprehensive university education, research excellence, e�ﬁ  cient 
and accountable university management, and work environment 
processes.
The University of Warsaw Strategy for 2023–2032 2
I am pleased to be able to present the University of Warsaw Strategy for 2023–2032, developed by our University
 community. I believe that the Strategy will ensure the optimal development of the University and the necessary changes 
in the coming decade. I hope that we will pursue it together with conviction and commitment. We are and want to be an 
institution that prides itself on its academic traditions, the great scientiﬁ  c heritage of the University, and a University with 
a strong sense of uniqueness. A University that can also care about what is unique and speciﬁ  c to us. I do hope that our 
new Strategy will become a tool which will contribute to the improvement of the conditions for providing outstanding and 
ground-breaking research, as well as to the strengthening of teaching excellence. We wish to build the University as an 
open, pioneering but responsible academic community with its foundation built on independence, commitment, courage of 
thought, tolerance, as well as on respect and dialogue. We highly value the social role that results from our more than two 
hundred years of tradition in academic education and research. It is therefore clear to us that the learning outcomes and 
the results of our research work should increasingly serve our social environment, improve people’s quality of life, but also 
contribute to the improvement of the natural environment. Our position as a leader among national academic institutions 
obliges us to continuously build a strong centre of new ideas, critical thinking, curiosity about the world, and also to foster 
civic attitudes. We desire to root these values ever more ﬁ  rmly in the University’s fundamental responsibilities: academic 
education, research and cooperation with the social environment.

Strategic development of the University of Warsaw, due to the complexity and scale of 
operations of such a large university, as well as the dynamics of change in today’s world, 
requires a vision of a university that is innovative, ambitious, striving for excellence, 
open to change and dialogue, as well as promoting attitudes of responsibility and com-
mitment. In order to achieve this over the period of the next 10 years, the UW plans to 
strengthen capacity building in the area of comprehensive university education, research 
excellence, e� ﬁ  cient and accountable university management, and work environment 
processes. 
The strategy outlines the UW development path for 2023–2032, which will result in strength-
ening the University improvement mechanisms. Thus, the foundation for our activities will 
include:
⚫  the objectives identiﬁ  ed in 1816 by the founders of the University of Warsaw:
⚫   The Mission Statement, adopted by the UW Senate on 26 September 2001:Th  e University is not only to maintain in the nation the sciences and skills 
as they already stood in the scholarly world, but moreover to perfect them, 
propagate them and apply their theory to the use of the community.
1. Th  e foundation of the University is the unity of science and teaching.
2. Th  e social mission of the University is to provide access to knowledge 
and skills acquisition to all those who are entitled to it.
3. Th  e civic mission of the University is to shape such elites of the Polish Republic, 
which will use “imperio rationis” rather than “ratione imperii” in their activities.
4. Th  e cultural mission of the University is to synthesise universal and local values.
The UW vision
The University of Warsaw Strategy for 2023–2032 4
We wish the University of Warsaw to be a place for people with passion and ambition, ready 
for self-improvement, an institution which promotes creative attitudes, courage to take on 
new research challenges and ambitious teaching, scientiﬁ  c and teaching activity, freedom and 
independence of the University, respect for the common good and the good name of the UW , 
high ethical standards, respect for universal values, human rights and civil liberties and open-
ness to diversity.
Multidimensional objectives – timeless 
processes in the face of new challenges
Strategy – matrix approachConsultation with the academic community on the path forward for the University has made 
it possible to identify priority strategic and operational objectives in the Strategy. The ob-
jectives are embedded in the four pillars of the University’s activities (comprehensive teach-
ing; research excellence; responsible university management and infrastructure develop-
ment; sustainable and activating working environment) and have been arranged according 
to the most important contexts arising from the current challenges and opportunities facing 
the University – the so-called dimensions (social impact; responsibility and internal processes; 
digitalisation; community building and internationalisation).

Our Strategy lays the foundations for the 
development of the University of Warsaw 
and answers four important questions:
The University of Warsaw, as the best academic centre in the country, wishes to build a high 
position in the Central and Eastern European region. For this reason, our priority is, among 
other things:
⚫  to provide comprehensive, innovative education which strengthens the unity 
of education and research, and which respects the subjectivity of learners and takes 
into account the development of digitalisation processes;
⚫  learner-centred education which equips learners with the competences of the 
future, broadens cognitive horizons, attitudes of openness to the world and critical 
thinking remains crucial; 
⚫  in view of the need for continuous improvement of the quality of education, 
cooperation with the outside world and making learning pathways more �lexible 
are becoming important. How to educate in times of truth-seeking 
and important social challenges?
Comprehensive teaching
Our priorities will be assisted by operational objectives framed in several dimensions:
1.1 By nurturing talents and attitudes, we change the world 
(Dimension – the UW impact on society): 
⚫   harmonious development of the knowledge, skills and personality of students 
 and doctoral students, also through the deepening of sporting and artistic culture;
⚫   the development of competences necessary to face complex problems and 
 challenges in a creative way, including critical thinking and analytical skills;
⚫  innovative and interdisciplinary teaching, as well as making educational pathways  
 more �lexible, introducing modular formulas;
⚫   cooperation with the external environment in the ﬁ  eld of education, including 
 experts, the education sector , and the graduates.1The University of Warsaw Strategy for 2023–2032 6

The success of the Strategy depends 
on our shared commitment to 
its implementation 
The Strategy will become an impetus to stimulate the development of the University and 
the whole community, and will help strengthen the UW position as a leading university in 
Poland, including in particular its status as a research university. The development Strategy is 
a concept for strengthening what we do well, but also a vision for the future of the University of 
Warsaw, and the measure to target e� forts and resources toward the of its greatest strength, 
potential and need. The jointly created Strategy will be an opportunity to engage and identify 
the community with the University in the upcoming years of joint implementation.⚫  Working out how to achieve the Strategy objectives will require us to be thorough, 
�lexible and adaptive in our operational planning. 
⚫  A detailed Implementation Plan will be developed to operationalise 
and continuously update the objectives and targets. 
⚫  The Strategy document formulates exemplary indicators by means of which the 
achievement of the objectives in each pillar will be monitored and measured in the following 
years.
⚫  The implementation Plan will set out activities, target values for indicators, as well 
as organisational, human and ﬁ  nancial resources and an implementation schedule. 
The implementation of the Plan will take place with the participation of the entire 
university community. 
⚫  We envisage cyclical reviews of the implementation of the Strategy, allowing us 
to measure the progress of implementation (including the achievement of milestones), 
as well as updating strategic objectives, targets, deadlines, deliverables and necessary 
resources.Strategy implementationThe University of Warsaw Strategy for 2023–2032 16
