Strategic planning plays a pivotal role in transforming our University and ti was really exciting to develop our Plan with full participation from staff, students and external stakeholders, aligning ti to the strategies and directions of the Kingdom's Higher Education Council and especially Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030.

Combined, these form our nine Strategic Objectives.
Students are central to al that we do and our Strategic Plan will ensure we provide the best possible learning experience, focusing on employability, strong

Applied Science University was granted its licence by the Ministry of Education according to the decree issued by the Minister's Council (No. WD 140/2004) dated 5th July 2004, making it one of the first private universities in the Kingdom of Bahrain.
ASU aspires to become one of the leading universities in the Kingdom of Bahrain and in the wider Gulf region. The University aims to support the economic and social development of the Kingdom of Bahrain by providing degree programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Our programmes are grounded in a pedagogical framework designed to develop students' understanding of key theories and concepts through knowledge acquisition and development of practical skills, with a focus on providing programmes in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). We aim to foster life-long learning and to prepare our graduates for a range of career paths within their chosen field or discipline.
ASU employs experienced and well qualified academic faculty who support student learning and the overall student experience through provision of research-informed teaching, supported by a comprehensive range of learning and assessment methods. This approach ensures that ASU graduates are well-equipped and capable of facing the challenges of their professional careers.
At its formation, ASU was situated in the Juffair district of Bahrain, and relocated to its new purpose-built campus in September 2013. The new campus covers an area of 24,000sq.m, designed to accommodate around 1,690 students at a time (giving a total capacity of 5,070 students distributed across mornings, evenings and
weekends).
The campus is designed to provide an excellent educational environment, in
accordance with the highest international and local standards using the latest
technology in classrooms, including design studios, lecture halls, computer labs, language and specialized laboratories, as well as a high-tech library, incubation centre and a state-of-the-art lecture theatre with 292 seats. Wi-Fi connection is
available across the campus. There is also a Student Activity Centre, featuring table tennis, billiards, table-football and computer games; together with outdoor courts for tennis, basketball, etc. In addition, located throughout the campus are social spaces with seating, a coffee shop and a cafeteria.
The location of the campus is an ideal geographical position, situated in the Central Governorate between Manama and Riffa, making ti easily accessible from all parts of Bahrain.
