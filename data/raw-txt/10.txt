Founded in 1863, today Politecnico di Milano is the largest scientific-technological 
university in Italy. A modern university where, both in teaching and research, 
quality and innovation are the foundations of a strong and lasting relationship 
with the social and productive system and with foreign institutions in the fields of 
architecture, design, and engineering. A reputation built in one hundred and sixty 
years with commitment and vision.
Today, defining the university’s development strategy means facing a highly 
competitive system. It means challenging the policies adopted by the world’s 
leading universities, which are more attractive to students and professors, and able 
to draw financial resources. It means creating links within international networks 
outlining new scenarios in Europe and worldwide.
In a global context where knowledge and technological innovation are strategic 
drivers, easiness of access to information, knowledge, and expertise can lead 
to distorting effects, both for those who govern technologies and for those who 
are left behind. Academia has the challenging but complex task of rethinking the 
boundaries of knowledge and its area of application. This is accompanied by the 
progressive detachment of the financial system from the real economy, together 
with serious consequences for Western countries, with the progressive weakening 
of welfare policies, and with a growing sense of distrust towards institutions. This 
domino effect requires universities to play an ethical role due to their responsibility 
towards new generations.PREFACE
Politecnico di Milano: identity, values, and aims
4
It is within this unstable environment, recovering from a pandemic and challenged 
by a conflict in the heart of Europe, that Politecnico has to distinguish itself as 
a solid, recognisable and reliable reference point, both in Italy and abroad, 
capable of guiding public and private decisions in the long term. 
In this time of uncertainty, we find in our founding values the reasons to build 
a future characterised by continuous, sustainable, and inclusive growth. 
Responsibility, respect, integrity, professionalism, fairness, trust and transparency 
lead every choice we make and every action we take toward a future in which 
students and staff are our institution’s real asset.

A leading guide. A landmark. A solid, recognisable, and reliable reference 
point for sustainable development in Italy and Europe. This is how 
Politecnico di Milano intends to distinguish itself in the coming years: by its 
ability to tackle the main scientific and technological challenges according 
to an ethical dimension that interprets and declines the very concept of 
sustainability as a synonym for equity, inclusion and shared growth.
 
It is in the interplay between scientific rigour and creativity that our university 
aims to establish itself as an international community of people united in 
diversity. An attractive community for students and researchers from all 
over the world; dedicated to significantly contributing to social and cultural 
development. 
MISSION
7
Politecnico di Milano, among the biggest universities in Italy, firmly embraces 
the principles underlying sustainable growth, of which the Strategic Plan is a 
clear statement. In the fullest and deepest sense of the term, sustainability 
means “caring for, supporting and fostering” an integral development of 
individuals and the whole society, as well as the environment. It is an expression 
of increased awareness and maturity. It indicates a unifying perspective for 
the three academic domains: research, teaching and social responsibility. It 
offers opportunities for shared growth within our community: from inclusion 
to diversity, from an improved quality of life to participatory involvement in 
university activities.
↳ In terms of TEACHING, sustainability means educating our students to 
critically address major global challenges and local needs, offering them 
appropriate models and concrete tools in an environment that fosters the right 
to education and equal opportunities.
↳ In terms of RESEARCH, a sustainable approach requires understanding 
and adequately assessing the ethical implications of scientific progress 
and technological development. It extends disciplinary perspectives to 
humanities. It develops partnerships with top national and international 
research institutions. It guarantees independent, high-quality research with a 
focus on talent development and the careers of young researchers. 
↳ In terms of SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, a sustainable proposal recognises 
and consolidates actions and projects in response to the needs of the city, the 
region, the country and in terms of international cooperation. Accordingly, we 
will draft the first Strategic Sustainability Plan to measure and validate the 
results and effectiveness of our choices. COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

ANALISI

The vision that shapes our future starts from the European Union’s six core 
values: human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, respect for 
human rights. These are accompanied by the goals of the New European 
Bauhaus initiative, whose central focus is the value of beauty, not only as a 
stand-alone aesthetic quality but as a measure of the protection of ecosystems, 
of the harmonious relationship between places and people, between economic 
growth and the use of resources. Politecnico di Milano is a European university 
through and through, in its roots and ambitions.
According to this perspective, education is central to the university’s strategic 
lines. In this direction, we will continue to experiment and apply innovative 
teaching models, characterised by hybrid and multidisciplinary forms, 
interactive processes, far from classroom-taught lectures, in a cosmopolitan 
environment open to international exchange.
Scientific research, which has always been an integral part and a driving 
force of the Politecnico, will open new opportunities with a focus on the 
stable recruitment of young researchers, also thanks to the collaboration 
with already existing European networks and new ones that we will create to 
consolidate our goals in talent development. Also, we must remind the many 
initiatives of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) that puts us in 
a strong position to open new innovation scenarios.
It will therefore be crucial to rethink physical space to create more flexible 
places for study, research, and exchange; places that are sustainable (from 
an environmental and energy point of view), welcoming (to promote well-being 
and safety), accessible and liveable. Places that extend the university within 
the city and the local area, both at a physical and cultural level, to face new 
events, starting with the 2026 Winter Olympics.VISION
11
Politecnico di Milano adopts multi-directional strategies according to the 
context it refers to, starting from the Italian one. A context in which, in addition 
to increasing the number of graduates, there is still much to be done on the 
gender gap side, especially in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and 
Mathematics) subjects, and in strengthening high-level education.
The Italian university system is also characterised by low attractiveness, 
public funding notoriously below the OECD average, and the effects of a poorly 
rewarding resource distribution policy. These are all factors that have strongly 
steered Politecnico’s research efforts towards international funding and 
joint initiatives with industrial partners. From large companies to start-ups, 
Politecnico is at the centre of a competitive and highly innovative ecosystem.
It is therefore not surprising that, despite the constraints imposed by still 
rather rigid disciplinary boundaries, Politecnico has distinguished itself for its 
ability to develop joint initiatives aimed at exploring transdisciplinary topics 
with partner universities in both Italy and overseas, paying close attention to 
the quality of outgoing profiles.
Not least, our university has invested, with great conviction, in social 
responsibility, cooperation, and educational development initiatives. Indeed, 
the university is now once again a point of reference for the growth of local 
communities. An extraordinary opportunity for social mobility and inclusion.POSITIONING

SWOT ANAL YSIS 
The SWOT Analysis provides a picture of Politecnico’s strengths and 
weaknesses, opportunities and threats regarding its positioning in the local, 
national and international context, based on the needs, expectations and goals 
expressed by a detailed analysis conducted among the relevant stakeholders. 
The first distinguishing feature is certainly Politecnico di Milano’s prestige, 
which, from the quality of education and research to economic soundness, 
places it on the shortlist of the twenty best universities in the world in its 
three domains of study: 10th in Architecture, 8th in Design and 18th in 
Engineering according to the QS World University Rankings 2023. Yet, 
there are still many structural weaknesses: from the limited availability of 
spaces to the low degree of internationalisation of teaching staff and the 
limited ability to influence the country’s development policies. In addition, 
it faces contingent threats, dictated by the critical geopolitical situation, 
the widespread distrust in institutions and the limited resources available 
compared to major international universities. These should not, however, limit 
our natural inclination to accept new challenges and opportunities.
This is why, to support the identification of the actions in this plan, the analysis 
of internal factors (resources and limitations) and external factors (favourable 
and unfavourable external circumstances) was conducted with particular 
attention to the following areas of strategic interest: People, Education, 
Research, Social Responsibility.

People are the beating heart of Politecnico di Milano. A diverse community of 
researchers, professors, technicians, administrators, and students from today 
and the past. A large community that feeds all our activities, from research 
to teaching, from innovation to social service. People’s serenity and well-
being, a sense of belonging to the institution and pride in being part of it are 
key conditions for everyone to express themselves to the fullest and they also 
define the quality of the work we carry out. 
It is our responsibility to attract the best national and international profiles: 
students, scholars, researchers, and professionals with a high and proven 
cultural and scientific background. It is our duty to bring out talents, to indulge 
passions and aspirations, to allow everyone to demonstrate and enhance 
their potential for personal and professional growth, to promote inclusion 
and diversity, and to accommodate, when necessary, the small and great 
vulnerabilities that lie hidden in each of us. 
For this, the Politecnico community must work in harmony with flexible work 
and study spaces that support personal needs, in line with new organisational 
and teaching processes. Contemporary spaces that meet the demands of the 
university population and citizens in terms of semantics, functionality and 
meaning.STRATEGIC GUIDELINES

Learning is not acquiring erudition but gaining education and developing 
awareness. Teaching is a responsibility towards new generations, the planet 
and society. Education is, first and foremost, a great opportunity for individual 
and collective growth that values merit and does not discriminate. This is why it 
is crucial to foster an environment that supports the right to education, equal 
opportunities and social inclusion.
Our university will further strive to attract and select the best students from all 
over the world as well as ensure that they receive high-quality international 
education through the acquisition of skills and tools that will enable them to 
smoothly move into the labour market.
For these reasons, the process of experimenting with innovative teaching 
methodologies, long initiated by our university, will be consolidated and 
implemented, defining new tools and new organisational, orientation and 
pedagogical models. Politecnico will strengthen personalised paths, new 
professional, multi- and inter-disciplinary profiles, continuing education, and 
lifelong learning.

Politecnico di Milano’s research is developed within the boundaries dictated by 
the principles of scientific and ethical integrity and is aimed at having a positive 
impact on the major challenges of modern society. It serves the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), respecting the environment and the planet. 
Therefore, our university intends to support and promote excellence and 
frontier research, increasing its competitiveness also in the context of 
European university alliances. Accordingly, measures aimed at the development 
of PhD programmes, the support of young researchers and the selection 
of incoming profiles are important. The development of special projects, 
capable of capturing and anticipating future trends in scientific research and 
technological development, is crucial. 
The contribution to the measures and actions of the National Recovery and 
Resilience Plan (NRRP) is decisive, as is the active involvement of business 
partners in the field of applied research. Joint projects with companies 
and public institutions, as well as business initiatives and the development of 
research infrastructures are also pivotal thanks to the growth of the innovation 
district in the Bovisa area. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES

Social responsibility includes actions carried out as a complement and in 
synergy with teaching and research in favour of social, cultural, environmental, 
and economic development. They activate a process of mutual exchange and 
enrichment with civil society.
Our university wants to design and manage these initiatives even more broadly 
and across the board: from environmental sustainability and climate change 
mitigation to social innovation; from supporting entrepreneurship to science 
diplomacy; from open cultural, educational, and scientific events to projects 
with a major impact on the city and the region.
Within this framework, Politecnico intends to make its commitment even more 
meaningful, systematic, and organic; planned, managed, and participated; 
differential and visible to get the involvement and awareness of an increasingly 
large audience.

The picture outlined so far describes a complex and challenging project, based 
on a shared approach and constant interaction ranging from Departments 
to Schools, to Campuses; from students to Alumni; from companies to 
public administrations; from cultural and service sector institutions to major 
international universities. 
That is why, along with the Rector and the Executive Vice Rectors, we have 
introduced the Vice Rectors, committed to advancing and exploring the key 
issues of this mandate, supported by fifty Delegates. A model that, by its very 
definition, aims to characterise a shared commitment, a broad vision, and an 
inclusive management.
