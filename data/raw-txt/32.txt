KFUPM Vision, Misson and Strategic Plan
Since its inception, King Fahd University of Petroleum and
Miner als has strived to attract the best faculty and students
while developing outstanding programs and adopting best
practices from leading institutions . The University has also
developed initiatives that made a signiﬁcant impact in the

To sustain its excellence, KFUPM’ s strategic decisions and
initiatives are made at the university level after considering
inputs from all colleges and depart ments. The OPQ is solely
responsible for the coor dination of KFUPM’ s str ategic plan. 
The ﬁrst round of the university ’s strategic planning cycle
was conducted in 2005, for the period 2005:2011. During
this round, variou s initiatives that propelled the university
forwar d wer e implemented. 
In 2011, the unive rsity developed its second set of strategic
plans. This plan had a time horizon of ten years (2011-
2020). During this phase, KFUPM learned from the success
of the previous strategy and the challenges faced during its
implementation. 
In light of this, the strategy development process emplo yed
during this round involved a frame work that requir ed each
unit in the University to produce its strategies and
programs that would lead to the University 's overall vision,
mission, and strategic goals. This frame work which involved
setting KPIs to measur e achie vement assur ed active
involvement, ownership, and direct accountability of all
entities of the university .
