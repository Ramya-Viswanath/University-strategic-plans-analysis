Kyushu University VISION 2030 IUUQTXXXLZVTIVVBDKQKyushu University
Driving social change with integrative knowledge
Kyushu University Vision 2030 outlines our path to transform Kyushu University into a ‚Äúuniversity that drives social 
change with integrative knowledge.‚Äù Developed in parallel with our application to become a Designated National 
University Corporation, this ten-year vision was crafted based on numerous discussions across the university, including 
many with the young faculty members who will lead us into the future.
…π…π Universities are selected as Designated National University Corporations by Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Education, Culture, 
Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) with the expectation that they will boost their research and education capabilities 
to compete at the highest level in the world, and Kyushu University received this designation in November 2021.
…π…π Since its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted our lives and restricted our everyday activities, and its 
tremendous economic and social costs have yet to be fully grasped. Kyushu University must contribute to the restructuring 
of society to be more sustainable in this new era with and beyond COVID-19. We will draw upon our substantial research 
achievements and knowledge accumulated over our history to play a leading role in providing solutions to difficult 
problems posed by this rapidly changing landscape, rise to the next level, and become a true driving force toward the development of a sustainable society that prioritizes people‚Äôs well-being. 
…π…π Kyushu University‚Äôs vision of itself in 2030 is one of a university that attracts excellent researchers, accelerates 
research and innovation that lead to new value creation, and uses integrative knowledge that fuses the entire spectrum of 
knowledge‚Äîfrom the natural sciences to the humanities and social sciences and even design‚Äîto solve social problems and 
forge new social and economic systems. In short, a university that drives social change with integrative knowledge.
…π…π To accomplish this, Kyushu University must become a hub for global talent circulation and establish itself as a 
world-class knowledge platform that attracts superb talent and citizens' interests and creates new value through integrative 
knowledge. We will build this platform on curiosity-driven basic research, the cutting-edge research that these endeavors in 
turn spur, and education that cultivates inquisitive minds in students so that they can create the future.
…π…π Furthermore, we will make Kyushu University into the core of an innovation ecosystem capable of self-sustained 
growth by extending this wave of integrative-knowledge-driven reform in social and economic systems from Fukuoka 
outward to Asia and the world, reinvesting these achievements to further expand and 
develop the university‚Äôs research and education resources.
…π…π In conclusion, we are committed to Kyushu University Vision 2030 to further build 
upon the knowledge accumulated through our history and transform into an institute of 
higher education that offers and advances world-class research and education that appeal to 
students and researchers everywhere.Kyushu University
