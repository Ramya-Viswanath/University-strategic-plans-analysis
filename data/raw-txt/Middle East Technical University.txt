Since the day it was founded, Middle East Technical University has been an international institution 
of higher education with a leading and pioneering role in raising individuals who care about social 
and universal values and development, who attribute importance to creating a collective awareness 
of social responsibility, who are willing to adopt lifelong learning as a principle and are able to make 
a difference in the fields of science, technology, culture, and environment.
At the end of a democratic, participatory, and transparent process, benefiting from the three 
previous strategic planning experiences of our university, the 2023-2027 METU Strategic Plan has 
been completed with the contributions and suggestions presented by the committees (Strategic 
Planning Field Committees) consisting of representatives of various academic and administrative 
units. The COVID-19 pandemic that still continues during the preparation process of this work both 
affected the content of our Strategic Plan and also caused the preparation studies to be conducted 
both online and face-to-face. 
Within the strategic planning process, a great effort has been made, and meticulous studies were 
carried out in which the administrators, academic and administrative personnel, students, alumni, 
and external stakeholders of our university made significant contributions through conferences 
and various individual or institutional communication channels, as well as boards and committees. 
Our belief in and responsibility for producing, sharing, and passing on knowledge, as well as the 
unwavering values that we are proud to have, even under changing circumstances, have once again 
been manifested.
Our expertise, background, and the power we acquire from our human resources have guided us in 
determining our strategies. Our strategic priorities in becoming a university that transforms its region 
and the world for the well-being of the society, nature, and humanity have been determined as an 
interdisciplinary and holistic approach, collaboration and interaction, and reinforcing foundations 
and resources. Accordingly, together with the difficult problems of our country, our region, and the 
world, significance and priority have been attributed to research in basic sciences, an integrated THE PRESIDENT’S FOREWORD

education with research, and social contribution. While, on the one hand, adopting the strategy 
of sustaining and even further increasing its high-impact research studies in the areas where it is 
strong, on the other hand, our university has set the goal of playing a pioneering role in the newly 
emerging areas that are compatible with the competencies and priorities of ours. Among the other 
priorities set in our strategic plan are to strengthen all our resources and to increase cooperation and 
interaction at both national and international levels so that our entire ecosystem, which includes 
METU Ankara, Erdemli, and Northern Cyprus campuses and TEKNOKENT, can realize its goals. As well 
as completing our Plan, it is equally important to fulfill its requirements, monitor its progress, and 
evaluate the implementations. For this, our infrastructure and all the related mechanisms will be 
strengthened.   I firmly believe that we will successfully fulfill our responsibilities in this regard.  
I extend my gratitude to all the members who took part in the boards, committees, workgroups, 
and support teams during the preparation of our strategic plan, who assumed duties in conferences 
and worked on the presentation and printing of the plan, as well as to our students, academic 
and administrative personnel, alumni, and external stakeholders representing institutions and 
organizations for their contributions throughout the entire process.
Sincerely,
Prof. Dr. Mustafa Verşan KÖK
President

According to the Regulation on the Procedures and Principles Regarding Strategic Plans and 
Performance Programs and Activity Reports to be Prepared by Public Administrations, strategic plans 
of public administrations must be sent to the Presidency of Strategy and Budget for evaluation by 
the end of April before the first year of the period covered by the strategic plan. In line with this 
requirement, the efforts to prepare our university’s 2023-2027 Strategic Plan started in January 
2021 with various meetings. 
The coordination and reporting of the preparation process of the 2023-2027 Strategic Plan, which 
was presented to the Senate and the University Administrative Board in April 2021, was carried 
out by the University Strategic Planning Support Team (USPST), which consists of 12 people.  The 
academic and administrative personnel who contributed to the Strategic Planning Field Committees 
(SPFC) that conducted the strategic planning endeavors were determined in line with the 
recommendations of the Offices of Deans, Graduate Schools, and Administrative Units to represent 
different disciplines, experiences, and stakeholder groups as much as possible. Representatives from 
TEKNOKENT, Development Foundation, Erdemli Campus, and Northern Cyprus Campus also took part 
in the SPFCs. In addition, dozens of our members have voluntarily contributed to the efforts of the 
SPFCs, which consisted of a total of 154 individuals. During the strategic planning process, the SPFCs 
worked in eight fields, separately but in coordination, on a regular basis almost every week. These 
fields are Education, Research and Development, Social Contribution, Internationalization, 
Human Resources, Financial Resources, Physical Resources, and Information Resources. Within 
the strategic planning endeavors of the SPFCs, interviews, focus group meetings, and surveys 
were conducted with our stakeholders, such as our departments, units, students, academic and 
administrative personnel, alumni, and various public, industrial and non-governmental organizations.
On June 24-25, 2021, the Strategic Plan Situation Assessment Sharing Conference was held with the 
participation of nearly 250 stakeholders from inside and outside the university. On March 28, 2022, 
the draft of the Strategic Plan was shared with the internal stakeholder representatives.  
The working schedule of the units and stakeholders taking part in the strategic planning process can 
be seen in Table 3.  All documents regarding this process, including the minutes, related reports, and 
feedback, can be accessed via the website https://kalite.metu.edu.tr/ by logging in with the password 
used for the university’s web pages.
The first version of the Strategic Plan and the second version that was prepared in line with all the 
institutional reviews and suggestions regarding the first version were brought together by the USPST 
by staying true to the essence of the plan.  Conflicting or missing issues were re-evaluated by the 
SPFCs and/or SPFC coordinators, and the corrected texts were discussed in the University Strategic 
Planning Board (USPB). The Strategic Plan prepared for the 2023-2027 period was discussed and 
approved at the joint meeting of the Senate and the University Administrative Board on April 26, 
2022.STRATEGIC 
PLANNING 
PROCESS2
A four-stage method was followed to prepare the 2023-2027 METU Strategic Plan based on the 
Strategic Planning Guide for Universities prepared by the Presidency of the Strategy and Budget and 
also benefiting from the previous strategic planning experiences of our university. These four stages, 
the details of which will be shared in the following sections of the document, are as follows:
1. Preliminary Preparation for the Strategic Plan
2. Situation Analysis (detailed analysis of the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan; determination of  
     working and non-working aspects)
3. Drafting the Strategic Plan 
4. Finalization of the Strategic Plan
According to the working schedule in Table 3, eight field committees based on the structure 
of the current strategic plan were formed for the preparation of the strategic plan: Research and 
Development, Education, Social Contribution, Financial Resources, Physical Resources, Human 
Resources, Information Resources, and Internationalization.
Unlike the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, the area of responsibility of the SPFCs was expanded for this 
strategic plan to function better and for the continuity of the participation of all stakeholders to 
be ensured. While the SPFCs play a key role in the preparation of the Strategic Plan, they are also 
responsible for contributing to the 5-year monitoring and evaluation processes of the Strategic Plan.
This method is based on the proposals developed by cross-functional committees (SPFCs) consisting 
of representatives of different academic and administrative units, institutional reviews of the 
academic and administrative units related to these proposals, and finally the evaluations of the USPB, 
all within a participatory, transparent, and democratic process.
In this context, all the evaluations regarding the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan preparation process 
were reviewed and reinforced with the lessons learned, and a guide was created for the 2023-2027 
Strategic Plan period with innovative approaches. The committees consisting of internal and external 
stakeholders primarily evaluated the situation over the previous Strategic Plan, enabling everyone to 
self-evaluate both at the unit and institutional levels. 
In this regard, the field committees played an important role in compiling the information requested 
during the situation analysis phase and determining the field-specific strategies and targets. The 
results of the works of the field committees formed an essential input for the Situation Analysis 
Report prepared after the USPB and the Situation Analysis Conference. The duties and responsibilities 
within the METU 2023-2027 Strategic Plan preparation process are given in Section 7.1. 
METU 2023-2027 Strategic Plan was prepared with the participation of all stakeholders of the 
institution, as well as benefiting from the previous Strategic Plans. The calendar for the strategic 
planning process can be found in Table 3.   10

3.1.  INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND
Education at our university started on November 15, 1956, when its name was the Middle East High 
Technology Institute. The purpose of the foundation was to contribute to the development of Türkiye 
and the Middle East and to train experts in the fields of Natural Sciences and Social Sciences, as 
well as Architecture and Design. After the enactment of Law No. 6887 regarding the preparation 
arrangements for the foundation of our university on January 29, 1957, the Foundation Act No. 7307 
that set forth the official status of METU and rendered it as a juridical entity, entered into force on May 
27, 1959. As a pioneering university, METU has introduced various new methods and innovations to 
the Turkish higher education system. In its earliest years, METU was located in a small building that 
belonged to the Social Security Office of Retirees on Müdafaa Street in Kızılay and in the barracks 
behind the National Grand Assembly (TBMM). Then, in 1963, the university moved to its current 
campus location. In 1956, the Department of Architecture became the first academic program 
to start offering education. Then, in the spring semester of 1957, the Department of Mechanical 
Engineering launched its academic program. At the onset of the 1957-1958 Academic Year, the 
Faculty of Architecture, the Faculty of Engineering, and the Faculty of Administrative Sciences were 
established. The establishment procedures of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were completed in 
1959. The Faculty of Education launched its academic program in 1982.
In 1973, the METU Board of Trustees decided to establish campuses outside Ankara with the vision of 
being a regional university in the Middle East instead of a local one, and the mission of spreading the 
academic and scientific experiences obtained in Ankara to the rest of the country. Founded in 1973, 
the METU Gaziantep Campus was the first campus of METU to be established outside of Ankara. In 
Gaziantep, the Department of Mechanical Engineering affiliated to the METU Faculty of Engineering 
was launched in 1973. Then, with the launch of the Department of Electrical Engineering in 1974, the 
Gaziantep Faculty of Engineering was established. The Department of Basic Sciences was established 
in 1974, the Department of Applied Chemistry in 1977, the Department of Civil Engineering in 1981, and 
the Department of Food Engineering in 1982. Then, the Department of Basic Sciences was converted 
into the Department of Physics Engineering. With Law No. 3389, the Gaziantep Campus gained a 
different legal entity in 1987 and became Gaziantep University. In 1975, METU Graduate School of 
Marine Sciences was established in Erdemli, a town located 45 kilometers west of the city center of 
Mersin. Being the first campus of a Turkish university based abroad, METU Northern Cyprus Campus 
was established upon the invitation of the Republic of Türkiye and the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus to METU. Following the triple protocol signed in 2000, the law that officially established the 
campus entered into force in 2003, and thus the METU Northern CyprusCampus started offering 
education. As of 2021, there are approximately 30,000 students enrolled in the programs of METU in 
the Ankara, Erdemli, and Northern Cyprus Campuses of the university. In the Ankara Campus, there 
are 41 undergraduate programs affiliated to a total of 5 faculties. In the Northern Cyprus Campus, 
there are 15 undergraduate and five graduate programs.   19
SITUATION 
ANALYSIS 
3
In the Erdemli Campus, there are three graduate programs within the Graduate School of Marine 
Sciences. A total of 107 masters programs (with and without thesis) and 72 doctoral programs 
currently offer education within the Graduate School of Natural and Applied Sciences, Graduate 
School of Social Sciences, Graduate School of Applied Mathematics, Graduate School of Marine 
Sciences, and the Graduate School of Informatics. The medium of instruction at METU is English. 
English language education is provided to the students registered in the Preparatory School by the 
School of Foreign Languages.
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE 2018-2022 STRATEGIC PLAN
In order to accomplish the vision and mission stated in the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, a total of 24 goals, 
59 objectives to realize these goals, and 134 performance indicators regarding these objectives were 
determined. While preparing the strategic plan, the university determined its goals in accordance 
with the top policy documents and the situation assessment and decided on objectives to realize 
these goals.
The difficulties experienced in the strategic plan monitoring and evaluation process were recorded in 
evaluation reports. Therefore, the following situations have been evaluated as experiences obtained 
in the strategic planning process.
• Since the 3rd and 4th Performance Indicators (PI3: Number of students doing volunteer teaching) 
(PI4: Number of institutions/foundations cooperating for the METU academic personnel to teach 
at the level of secondary schools) of Objective 2 (O2: Supporting education at secondary level) 
under Goal 2 (G2: To work towards increasing the quality of secondary education) in the field 
of Education were not clear and easy enough to understand, the process of data collection was 
adversely affected, and thus a conceptual change was made.
• With the pandemic that started in 2020, various difficulties were experienced in reaching 
the targeted performance values due to the fact that education had to continue online for a 
long time, and social and cultural activities were limited during the pandemic. For instance, 
Objective 1 (O1: Designing and offering a course [METU-101] specifically for incoming students’ 
adaptation to the university) of the Goal 4 (G4: To ensure the incoming students’ adaptation 
to the university and provide them with the advisory service they will need throughout their 
education) was negatively affected due to the pandemic. Since distance education continued 
actively throughout this period, the content planned to be included in the new scope of our 
university had to be placed in different applications and assistance programs by the relevant 
units; and through satisfaction surveys, students were asked to evaluate these activities and 
processes. 
• Because the 1st and 2nd Performance Indicators (PI1: Total area of land on which maintenance 
work is performed) (PI2: Number of tree seedlings planted annually) under Objective 1 (O1: 
Preserving the rich natural and ecological values of the campus) of Goal 16 (G16: To protect 
the integrity and biodiversity of the campus’s rich forest, steppe, and lake ecosystem) were not 
determined cumulatively, this led to an erroneous evaluation of the performance during the 
monitoring and evaluation processes.3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 20
Baseline Risks 
 Interdisciplinary Approach
•  Interdisciplinary staff and structure putting pressure on the disciplinary 
departments 
•  The negative perception of interdisciplinarity due to the workload that the 
support provided to interdisciplinary programs could create in disciplinary 
departments, and priority problems that may occur among departments while 
sharing the workload among faculty members
 Education 
• Not being able to share the results of the studies with the relevant stakeholders 
at a level that will affect the education policies, and the fact that it is not easy to 
observe these effects created 
• Inability to follow the effects of the supported projects adequately, not reaching 
the annual number of volunteering students, and not reaching the annual 
number of supporting institutions/organizations 
• The compulsory courses determined by the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) 
preventing the creation of a core program
• The heavy workload of faculty members making it difficult to offer new elective 
courses  
 Research and Development 
• Limitation of sharing due to copyright issues, and failure to establish 
collaborations at the desired level  
• Lack of communication and interaction among researchers, units, and external 
stakeholders
• Difficulty in coordination between different disciplines and departments
• Insufficient understanding of the research conducted at METU in terms of social 
benefits
• Researchers sharing the research processes and results only in academic 
environments, thus making it difficult for the society to be aware of the 
scientific research that is closely related to them
Financial Resources
• Unforeseen legislative regulations, limited opportunities for funding and 
providing staff to the research centers
• Insufficient investments and previously planned administrative/technical 
improvements
• Low budget performance, not being able to use the budget when needed21
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
In addition to all these evaluations, some baseline risks were determined that emerged during the 
current strategic plan period at our university and could possibly have adverse effects on the process 
in terms of observation and sustainability.
Human Resources
• Working conditions and benefits offered by foundation universities, in particular, 
creating competition in hiring qualified academics and preventing them from 
leaving the institution 
• Difficulties in career planning and hiring qualified administrative personnel
• Difficulties in hiring qualified academic personnel as a result of the uncertainties 
and slow progress of the employment processes 
• Deterrent effects of regional conflicts and security problems on international 
students, the negative image of Türkiye in international academic environments 
and interruption of collaborations, the decrease in the interest of qualified 
academics in working in Türkiye, and the increase in the number of academics 
leaving METU 
• Insufficient benefits and working conditions of international faculty members
• The dissatisfaction of students caused by failing to benefit from the opportunities 
adequately, the lack of units focusing on this, and the lack of coordination
• Insufficient number of administrative personnel competent in English 
• Not being able to renew and renovate some of the classrooms, laboratories, 
libraries, infrastructures, etc., due to the lack of financial resources; inability to 
conduct such arrangements for either maintenance reasons or as part of the 
endeavors of the Office of Disability Support quickly enough due to budget 
constraints.
These aforementioned risks will be carefully and continuously monitored in the upcoming evaluation 
periods. As a result of the conducted situation assessment, it has been determined that the 2018-
2022 SP is sustainable. In accordance with the evaluations above;
• The 2023-2027 Strategic Plan has been prepared in line with the principles set 
forth in the Strategic Planning Guide (Version 1.1, 2021).
• During its preparation, participatory and inclusive principles were taken into 
consideration in line with the goals and objectives, as well as the mission and 
vision of the university. 
• Goals, Objectives, Strategies, and Performance Indicators have been prepared 
in line with the principles of clarity, comprehensibility, and measurability 
by addressing the difficulties experienced in the monitoring and evaluation 
processes of the current strategic plan. 
• The situation assessments have been made taking into account the effects of 
the pandemic, and it has been kept in mind while determining the goals and 
objectives in the activity domains.
• Great importance has been given to participation and inclusiveness during 
the preparation of the Strategic Plan, and it has been aimed to continue with 
this approach in the monitoring and evaluation processes for this plan term to 
become one embraced by all the stakeholders.22

Within the past ten years, successful steps have been taken to keep the number of undergraduate 
students constant and to focus on masters and doctoral programs. This decision was made considering 
several aspects such as the demand and issues regarding the employment of academic personnel, 
the infrastructure of the departments, the current number of teaching staff, the compatibility of the 
department programs with the incoming student levels, and the efficiency of the departments.
3.9.2. Research Activities
The prioritized research fields of METU, as specified in the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, are Energy, 
Aerospace, Electronics-MEMS, and Biomedicine. While determining the prioritized fields of study, the 
compliance of our university and the national development goals were taken into consideration. Our 
activities in these priority fields are also valid for the 2023-2027 Strategic Plan. Conducting research 
with a multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and collaborative approach on regional and global, major 
and challenging problems; increasing comprehensive research that addresses these problems with 
their social, political, economic, psychological, and technological dimensions and produces solutions; 
developing national and international cooperation in this direction in R&D and innovation projects 
and expanding the extent of current cooperations are points of priority for Türkiye.
Activities that serve the purpose of increasing international recognition have been carried out. One 
of the several steps taken to realize this goal has been receiving the “HR Excellence in Research 
Award (HR Logo), ” an award given by the European Commission to institutions focused on being 
a Researcher Friendly University. METU became the first university in Türkiye to receive the Human 
Resources Excellence in Research Certificate (HR Logo), which is an important symbol of the credibility 
and international visibility of universities. Accordingly, METU will undergo a mid-term evaluation in 
two years and will provide more equal and facilitating opportunities to researchers by ensuring the 
implementation of the Action Plan submitted at the application stage.
3.9.3. Student  
In recent years, METU has seriously endeavored to increase the number and quality of its international 
students in line with its founding purposes. Apart from the ÖSYS quotas (in addition to the students 
from Türkiye and Northern Cyprus), approximately 300 new international students are admitted to 
METU every year, which makes up about 10% of the general YKS quota. As a result of the significance 
attributed to this issue by our university, the number of international undergraduate and graduate 
students at METU has been increasing gradually every year. The number of international students 
reached 1,482 in the 2020-2021 Academic Year. The number of joint undergraduate programs 
conducted in partnership with the world’s leading prominent universities is four, while the number 
of joint masters programs is six, and the number of joint doctoral programs is 12. In addition, there is 
one joint doctoral program. The expectations and attempts to increase the number of joint programs 
have been seriously interrupted due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the end of 
2021, the number of universities with which METU signed student and academic staff exchange 
agreements as part of international exchange programs increased to 971. The increase in the 
number of students going abroad for short-term education within Mevlana, ICM, European and Non-
European Erasmus (Erasmus+ International Credit Mobility-ICM), and other exchange agreements 
has also been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the end of 2021, a total of 217 METU 
students were able to go abroad within an international program.38
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 


3.10. ANALYSIS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR
Results of the Political Economic Social Technological Legal and Environmental 
(PESTLE) Analysis
 Political  
• There are rapid changes in the bureaucratic staff with whom METU cooperates.
• There is a need to develop strategies that ensure that METU will be affected by these 
changes as little as possible. At this point, it is crucial that the university is not too late 
to follow current political developments in the field of climate and environmental 
research, mass migration and informatics, in addition to keeping up with the latest 
innovations. There are changes in global policies due to both mass migrations and 
climate changes. METU needs to include global changes in its future projections and 
keep up with these changes.
• Universities cannot employ as many international academic personnel as they want 
in accordance with their needs.
• There is a decrease in the interest of international students in Türkiye as they tend to 
prefer to go to other countries.
• ERASMUS and similar program partners refrain from sending their students to 
Türkiye.
• There is a decrease in the interest of qualified academics in Türkiye, while some 
current faculty members leave METU.
• There are severe limitations in human resource development based on qualified 
informatics personnel due to the contraction trend in the employment of personnel.
• Commercialization of scientific knowledge significantly affects graduate education.
• There are no such practices as prioritizing some universities by the state in the 
accreditation of distance education programs, and these programs have negative 
effects on the processes.
• Institutions started to develop policies to continue using distance education 
methods and tools in the post-pandemic period – The incentive policies for (Open 
Education Resources, Open Courseware) have increased both in our country and in 
the world, and thus the need for creating a roadmap that will emphasize this aspect 
of educational processes has emerged.
• Government policies regarding the use and allocation of staff. 
• Legal factors; laws, regulations, rules, circulars, court decisions and legal precedents.
• Policies of YÖK regarding the operation and processes of universities.
• Changes made in financial policies.
• Changes made in employment policies.
• Employment in different statuses.
• Legal regulations regarding the rights of all academic/administrative employees.
• Legal regulations on student rights.40
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
 Economic
• Availability of public resources (e.g., the Presidency of Strategy and Budget, Ministry 
of Science, Industry and Technology, TÜBİTAK) and foreign resources (e.g., EU, 
World Bank, United Nations) for different activities and purposes such as research, 
education, and renewal of physical resources. 
• Difficulty in accessing competitive research funds with METU Centers of Excellence, 
research infrastructure, and qualified researcher profile.
• The increasing number of universities in our country causes the share of funds to 
decrease. There is difficulty in finding resources to improve physical resources. Public 
resources in particular have become quite difficult to benefit from. The global and 
national economic crises pose a threat to further restricted access to resources.
• Insufficient financial support for academic personnel to participate in activities 
abroad. 
• Bureaucratic difficulties in payments to the academic personnel for their activities 
abroad.
• Inadequate scholarship opportunities for full-time international students. 
• Inability to provide international students with funding for research
• The closure of the companies with which the university cooperates for educational 
purposes due to economic reasons, and thus the elimination of a possible way of 
supporting international students, which results in a decrease in the number of 
interns. 
• The elimination of funding provided to international students due to the decrease in 
the funds of the institutions that support international education.
• Since state universities are funded publicly and operate with these budgets, they are 
affected by the changes in the public financial budget structure.
• The effects of increasing unemployment rates on university students and alumni.
• The decrease in Türkiye’s growth rate directly affects the share of education and 
research within the budget, and the resources allocated for both undergraduate and 
graduate education have been reduced. 
• It is economically challenging to develop technology-based, distance-educated-
themed digital content.
• Difficulties of competing against foundation universities in order to attract qualified 
national and international students. 
• There is a need to develop necessary infrastructure opportunities for students and 
personnel with limited access to the necessary technologies and infrastructure.41
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
 Social 
• The need to define research topics in line with the needs at the international and 
national levels (such as energy, health, and education) and the need to define them 
according to basic fields of science, as well.
• Due to unpredictable global conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or 
interruption of research because of various reasons related to social or individual 
issues, research processes may be prolonged or may not be completed at all.
• The newly emerging tendency in Türkiye of universities integrating with society, 
developing research and social responsibility projects to solve social problems, and 
sharing the knowledge not only with the academia and students but also with all 
segments of society.
• The need for lifelong education, the increase in the information demand of different 
segments of society from universities and other sources.
• Rapid access to information, change in the profile of personnel, change in education 
processes due to the pandemic, and as a result, a change in the expectations of all 
stakeholders (university personnel, families, alumni, society, industry, other public 
institutions, and organizations).
• The necessity of examining the social changes brought about by the use of distance 
education technologies and determining how they can be transformed into benefits.
• Quick change of working patterns (remote, rotational, etc.).
• Increasing awareness of the importance of health.
• Increasing awareness of the importance of Occupational Health and Safety and its 
related processes.
• Increasing expectations from scientists due to the pandemic.
• The effects of the pandemic on the personnel.
• The effects of sports activities and social activities on the personnel.42
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
Technological 
• The technological infrastructure and experience gained as a result of the distance 
education period due to COVID-19.
• The fact that in addition to the conveniences (Integrated Information System, Cloud 
Technology, etc.) that were brought to our lives with the developments in the field 
of information resources, there is also a negative side to it, as well (such as cyber-
attacks).
• The fastest change in the world takes place in the conditions of technological 
environment. Considering that adaptation to rapid changes is possible with 
convenient human resources and budget, this interaction is negatively affected due 
to insufficient budgets. 
• Internet infrastructure has gained importance in recent years with the development 
of technology and the effects of the pandemic. 
• The necessity of planning and implementing technological developments in order 
to meet the new needs for (distance) education that arise during the pandemic 
within the university and may affect future education and training periods. 
• The technological environment in some of the rival universities or even some high 
schools is more advanced than METU.
• Remote working system implemented for the first time in public institutions due to 
the pandemic.
• Remote access to management and administrative services.
• The need for new automation software and information systems.
• Transfer of processes to an online medium, increasing the need for new products 
and services.
• Competency of all employees, including the personnel working in the field, in 
technology.
• Increasing threat of cyber-attacks, necessary technologies for data security, the 
necessity of taking precautions about information security 
• The research and education information produced at our university is one of our 
most important assets.  For this reason, in order to protect research and education-
related data, the necessary infrastructural improvements must be made regarding 
the synchronization and backup of data on the computers of users.
• As the concepts such as Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things, 3D printers, drones, 
virtual reality/augmented reality devices, and Cloud Computing become more 
and more widespread and affordable, there is a need for a rapid transformation of 
educational technologies and tools regarding research and social contribution.43
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
 Legal 
• The necessity of reflecting the changes made on the basis of daily needs in the 
regulations of YÖK to our education system properly. 
• The effect of the adaptation processes with the European Union in the field of 
education (such as the Bologna Process) on education programs. 
• The need to monitor and prevent the unlicensed use of educational technologies 
and digital broadcasts.
• Legal uncertainties and gaps in the distance education period due to KVKK.
• Employment of public personnel (officials, workers, and contractually employed 
personnel) through central exams such as the Public Personnel Selection Examination 
(KPSS).
• The significant effect (percentage-wise) of central exams such as the Academic 
Personnel and Graduate Education Entrance Exam (ALES) on the appointments for 
Lecturer and Research Assistant positions.
• Due to different disciplinary legal regulations and processes for employees of 
different statuses, there are different processes for the personnel doing the same 
work (officials, workers, and contractually employed personnel).
• Lack of disciplinary provisions in the legal regulations for international academic 
personnel.
• Lack of disciplinary provisions in the working principles of those who work as 
contractually employed personnel within Article 4/B of the Civil Servants Law No. 
657.
• Compliance of the personnel placed in public institutions and organizations within 
the Law on Fight Against Terrorism No. 3713 with the peace of labor and working life
• Regulations declared and entered into force through circular letters during the 
pandemic.
 Environmental
• The METU Forest being one of Ankara’s natural resources. 
• The Ankara Campus being an essential point of biodiversity in Ankara in terms of 
endemic butterflies and birds, in addition to the biodiversity and richness of steppe 
plants. 
• The Erdemli Campus is home to a very important, nationally protected breeding area 
for endangered sea turtles. In addition, because it is a well-managed and protected 
coastal area, the Erdemli Campus has vast biodiversity, which is why the campus 
administration is in close contact with the relevant Ministries and local governments.
• The natural environment and the campus, together with its culture and history, 
create a positive effect on the employees of METU.44
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
3.11. ANALYSIS OF STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES, AND  
            THREATS (SWOT)
As mentioned before, during the preparation efforts carried out by the SPFCs, various analyses were 
made to evaluate the current situation of our university. The USPST brought together all the analyses 
made by the SPFCs. The results of the SWOT Analysis, which constitutes one of the core elements of 
the 2023-2027 Strategic Plan, are listed below. 
 Strengths

• Ensuring cooperation with ODTÜ TEKNOKENT that results in significant and 
meaningful contributions to research and technology development
• METU having the required graduate programs to provide the human resources that 
can support the fields where it is strong such as the defense industry, information 
technologies, MEMS, and energy
• High student satisfaction rates regarding information services offered by the 
university (Mobile application, ODTÜClass, Student Portal, Licensed Software, VPN 
Service, Library Resources, etc.)45
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
• The fact that the university buildings are old, and the number of students and 
employees per square meter is quite high due to the architectural structure of 
buildings and overall the increasing number of students and personnel.
• The increase in the population of the campus and the fact that the campus is located 
in the city.
• Security problems on campus, which is located in the middle of a large forest, due to 
insufficient human resources and limited technological resources.
• The diversity of the methods used in the courses and assessments 
• Receiving feedback from students through course evaluation surveys that have 
been conducted consistently for a long time, being able to evaluate the unit-specific 
feedback and make necessary improvements 
• The ability of METU to develop quick and practical solutions to newly arising 
problems due to unforeseen circumstances (for instance, the interactive course 
registration was turned into a completely online process during the pandemic, and 
the P/F system (pass/fail) entered into force quickly, as well)
• Increase and diversification of national scholarship programs aimed at funding 
postdoctoral researchers, which are one of the most crucial components that 
contribute to increasing R&D performance (e.g., TÜBİTAK BİDEB 2232 and 2236)
• The natural environment and the campus, together with its culture and history, 
creating a positive effect on the employees of METU
• The social facilities and benefits such as personnel housing, kindergarten, primary 
and secondary school, and health services making METU attractive compared to 
other state universities
• The fact there are academic personnel at METU with high academic prestige and 
research potential attracts qualified undergraduate and graduate students to the 
university, as well as other qualified academics from other universities
• Presence of a qualified academic staff who can follow and contribute to the 
contemporary scientific developments in the world, since the language of instruction 
is English
• Access to international projects that will make METU a prioritized preference
• Having experienced individuals working in the sector or industry and willing to 
teach part-time at METU
• The easily accessible programs and projects that support career development 
(Academic Development Program, Administrative Personnel Development Program)
• In-service training opportunities for the administrative personnel
• The academic performance evaluation, a highly comprehensive system in which 
academic activities in a pretty wide range can be assessed
• Components of the Integrated Information System (IIS) such as the Scientific Research 
Projects Process Management System (BAPSİS) and Strategy Quality Management 
Information System (SKYBİS)
• Supporting participation in academic events such as conferences and seminars with 
various resources
• Effective legislation follow-up and protection of rights thanks to competent 
personnel
• Feeling privileged to be working at METU with a sense of belonging to the institution 
thanks to the positive perception of METU, its culture, and institutional branding.46
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
• The emergence of new funds against the problems caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, and the capacity of METU to contribute to the solution of these problems
• The Zero Waste Unit and the Zero Waste Management System in compliance with 
the legislation
• The fact that the task of creating a waste management plan and implementing it has 
been assigned to the municipalities in accordance with the legislation (Regulation 
on Controlling Packaging Wastes)
 Weaknesses
• Inability to employ a sufficient number of personnel in accordance with the needs, 
and inability to employ personnel with the desired qualifications
• Bureaucratic difficulties and lack of resources in both employing qualified 
international faculty members and researchers and having them to participate in 
research studies 
• Inability to inform the public regarding the conducted research projects and failure 
to emphasize the social aspect of these projects
• Insufficient human resources in terms of academic, administrative, and international 
personnel 
• Constraints in financial resources: insufficient classrooms, laboratories, and 
technological equipment
• Outdated physical infrastructure and buildings 
• The fact that not all the units have been through an international evaluation 
• Lack of communication, sharing, and promotion: failure to share academic outputs 
with the families, society, and media, and promote them enough
• Inability of the personnel to adapt to the rapid changes and developments of 
technology quickly enough
• Central exams (e.g., KPSS, ALES) restricting the chances of selecting the personnel to 
be employed and preventing the effective distribution of human resources within 
the institution
• The narrow and uncomfortable working spaces, especially in the old buildings, 
negatively affecting the motivation of the personnel
• The low number of administrative personnel with proficiency in a foreign language
• Adaptation of new technologies to the university practices taking time
• Distance to industry and technology centers
• Lack of defined ethical codes regarding the professional life
• Academic mid-level administrators (e.g., Chairs of Departments, Assistant Chairs of 
Departments) learning about administrative processes by experimenting with the 
trial and error method instead of receiving the necessary training on basic legal 
regulations and administrative processes47
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
• Lack of an APDP-like development program for the mid-level and senior 
administrators (e.g., Office Heads, Dormitory Managers, Faculty Secretaries, 
Graduate School Secretaries, and Division Directors) and thus the failure of these 
administrators to meet the expectations of the administrative personnel that 
participated in the APDP in the light of what they learned in the program, particularly 
in terms of administration
• Lack of events and activities where academic and administrative personnel can 
interact socially
• Insufficient number of administrative personnel, because while the “research 
university” status provides the institution with some academic personnel utilization 
opportunities, these cannot be used for employing administrative and technical 
personnel
• Lack of personnel who are trained to replace those who hold critical positions
• The fact that the responsibilities of the information systems used in the university 
(e.g., METUSIS, ODTÜPASS) and the rights related to social facilities (e.g., services of 
the Medical Center, meal fees at the Cafeterias) are not known to the personnel who 
work at the university with different statuses
• The current performance evaluation systems being criticized by the administrative 
personnel as problematic or insufficient
• Insufficient amount of housing allocated to the administrative personnel
• The lack of defined rights regarding performance awards and housing for the 
academic personnel who hold the title of “Lecturer” despite not teaching but 
working in other fields within the university
• The low level of satisfaction of the personnel with the infrastructure, maintenance, 
and renovation services
• The majority of the administrative personnel thinking their chances of being 
promoted in their position are limited
• The widespread perception of inequality and discrimination among employees 
with different statuses within the university (e.g., administrative-academic, worker-
officer)
 Opportunities
• Academic personnel utilization opportunities that the “research university” status 
provides (e.g., YÖK Future Project)
• Research budget opportunities brought by the status of “research university”
• The academic candidate pool consisting of the alumni who wish to continue their 
careers in academia and also have a sense of belonging to METU
• Research and incentive awards given by institutions such as TÜBİTAK and TÜBA
• Project supports of international institutions
• The increase of young faculty members both by number and percentage
• Being a point of attraction for successful young academics as part of the Marie Curie 
and TÜBİTAK’s reintegration fellowship programs48
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
• Improvements that the Office of Scientific Research Projects has made on the 
research projects processes
• The potential of METU to have Türkiye’s leading technopark (ODTÜ TEKNOKENT) 
with a high level of cooperation
• The contribution of research activities such as H2020, TÜBİTAK, and YÖK 100/2000 
doctoral scholarship calls to the quality of education
• Cooperations with national and international institutions, in addition to Erasmus 
and Mevlâna Programs
• The fact that our university is quite popular among students coming from Middle 
Eastern, Balkan, and Asian countries
• Contribution of the high number of international students to the cultural 
development and language skills of our students
• Increasing efforts to provide scholarships and dormitories to all the students in need 
of financial aid
• Endeavors to improve the services provided to students with disabilities (In 2019, our 
university was evaluated by YÖK and awarded the Orange Flag in the “Accessibility of 
Physical Areas” category within the “Barrier-Free University Awards”).
• Endeavors to increase the studying and socialization areas provided to the graduate 
students
• Career planning course 
• Efforts of the Center for Continuing Education, as well as the education activities 
conducted by some of the other research centers 
• Distance education system being integrated and rich in terms of software resources
• Advancement of digital transformation during the pandemic and even becoming 
sustainable
 Threats
• Deterrent effects of regional conflicts and security problems on international 
students, the negative image of Türkiye in international academic environments and 
the interruption of collaborations 
• The decline in the analytical/critical thinking skills of the newly-registered students 
due to the decrease in the quality of high school education, in addition to an 
inadequate level of English 
• Negative effects of the news in various media outlets claiming that the departments 
of basic sciences will be shut down on the preferences of prospective students
• Outdated physical infrastructure and inadequacy of modern education environments
• A decrease in the base scores over the years due to the increasing quotas of some 
undergraduate programs for student placements by YKS scores
• Increasing quotas of undergraduate programs
• Not allocating the required budget for the projects planned to be carried out within 
the scope of physical resources, and not getting the necessary permissions and 
approvals in this regard 49
3. SITUATION ANALYSIS 
• The recent economic crises on both national and global scales having adverse 
effects on the budgets of public institutions, in addition to decreasing purchasing 
power due to high inflation rates 
• Failure to complete some processes successfully due to fluctuations in purchasing 
costs caused by global and national economic crises
• Negative reflection of focusing on the fields of priority to other fields (e.g., social 
sciences, basic sciences); because of the allocation of funds such as TÜBİTAK and EU 
to certain fields, other fields are adversely affected in finding financial support 
• Absence of dynamic structures to handle compelling problems
• Lacking or inadequacy of the policy documents such as the “Gender Equality Plan, ” 
which became mandatory with the Horizon Europe program (for instance, they are 
only in Turkish)
• The possible negative effects of the pandemic period on the personnel
• The participation of the administrative personnel in the remote working system 
during the pandemic is low due to the lack of necessary technological equipment
• Due to the administrative permissions issued with circulars during the pandemic, 
the operation of some administrative offices with relatively fewer personnel is 
negatively affected
• The 2/3 ratio regarding the academic titles that has been implemented in the 
departments has caused the career paths to be closed for many academic personnel. 
As a result of it, it has become difficult for qualified academics to remain in their 
positions at the university
• The fact that the norm staff regulation is a disadvantage for the well-established 
universities
• Negative effects of the changes in research assistant position policies (especially the 
student amnesty)
• The fact that the numbers regarding the employment of administrative personnel 
do not even meet half of the number of personnel that have left the university in the 
last ten years
• Due to the fact that appointments made with special laws (No. 3713-2828) are made 
by central placement, personnel selection cannot be made, making it difficult to 
employ qualified personnel
• In addition, no statement has been made about the main purpose of the legal 
regulation regarding the privileges given to the personnel placed by the relevant 
laws on subjects such as job description and change of titles. There is hesitation about 
which personnel will be provided with this opportunity, and the need for an opinion 
to be given by the relevant authorities causes a loss of time in the operation of the 
relevant process. The said privilege also negatively affects the peace of the working 
environment among the personnel, and it is possible that there will be long court 
processes between the personnel and the institution regarding the implementation 
of the provisions of the article, which are interpreted differently.
• Limited governmental contribution to research funding, which has a negative effect 
on the efforts of attracting and retaining young researchers in particular50

5.1.  POSITIONING PREFERENCES
METU has always been a leading university across the nation in the fields of Education, Research 
and Development, University-Industry Cooperation, Internationalization, and Social Contribution. 
As a research university with 41 undergraduate programs, 107 masters programs, and 72 doctoral 
programs, it maintains its strong position in national and international research and development 
projects.
Just as in the previous years, our university once again obtained the highest score and remained in 
the first place in 2020 in the “Performance Monitoring Index of Research Universities, ” in which the 
performances of universities included in the “Research-Oriented Mission Differentiation Program” 
carried out by YÖK as part of the “Mission Differentiation and Specialization in Higher Education 
Project. ” It also ranked first according to the Entrepreneurial and Innovative University Index 2021, 
created by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye (TÜBİTAK).
With the new regulations made by YÖK in the “Mission Differentiation and Specialization on the 
Basis of Research” Program, research universities were divided into three performance groups as 
A1, A2, and A3, including candidate research universities, as well. In this new classification system, 
the Middle East Technical University was included in group A1 (universities with high-level research 
performance), in which there are three research universities with the highest performance.
In the international arena, METU has been the most successful Turkish research institution in the 7th 
Framework Program and also in terms of the number of projects funded in Horizon 2020 (H2020). 
METU currently hosts 53 Horizon2020 projects. According to the 2022 ranking of the UK-based 
Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) announced in 2021, METU was placed in the 551-560 band. In addition to 
an increase by 50 places, in the ranking compared to the previous year, our university also achieved 
an improvement of more than 8% at the percentile level. Furthermore, METU is the coordinator of 4 
European Research Council (ERC) projects and 2 Twinning projects.
5.2.  FIELD OF SUCCESS PREFERENCES
Within the studies carried out for the 2023-2027 Strategic Plan, our university has set strategic 
priorities that will differentiate its fields of success in order to strengthen its position, especially in the 
field of research and development. Therefore, four strategic priorities have been determined. 
These strategic priorities, determined by the contributions of stakeholders, have guided the SPFCs in 
their efforts to work on the Goals, Objectives, and Strategies.57
DIFFERENTIATION 
STRATEGIES 
5
Strategic Priority 1: A Holistic Approach
METU is a strong education and research institution, offering a wide range of undergraduate and 
graduate programs, and attracting qualified academics and students. An important element on which 
this strength is based is the rich content and diversity of programs. On the other hand, many concepts, 
problems, and issues are so multidimensional that they can be best understood when studied at 
the intersection of multiple disciplines. An interdisciplinary and supra-disciplinary approach will 
make significant contributions to the comprehension of the whole in relation with these concepts, 
gaining an in-depth understanding of the whole, creative and critical thinking, enhancement of 
knowledge, and utilization of this knowledge at the international level. It is important to strengthen 
the interaction between different disciplines as well as disciplinary studies in our university. For this 
reason, it is one of our strategic priorities to provide the necessary infrastructural investments, prepare 
the legislative amendments, and use the resources for this purpose effectively and efficiently. In line 
with this priority, it is aimed to increase research that has interdisciplinary and supra-disciplinary 
contributions, diversify and strengthen undergraduate and graduate programs in accordance with 
this understanding, remove the obstacles to active participation in these activities, and provide the 
necessary human, information, physical and financial resources.
At our university, it is important to reinforce education by integrating it with research. Therefore, 
it is planned to use the current research results to enrich the course alternatives and contents and 
make arrangements that will enable undergraduate students to take part in research projects and 
studies. For the efficient and effective use of all the resources, especially the information and physical 
resources, all aspects of campus life, but the academic dimension, in particular, will be supported 
with more integrated, more durable, more accessible, more sustainable, and smarter systems.
Strategic Priority 2: Cooperation and Interaction 
With its vision of making pioneering contributions to the social, cultural, and economic development 
and transformation of its region and the entire world, METU will conduct and lead activities in the 
fields of research, education, and social contribution. One of the most important strategic priorities in 
this regard is to understand critically important local, regional and universal problems as well as the 
needs of the society, and to cooperate and interact with the relevant stakeholders for the solution of 
these problems.
In addition to contributing to the solutions to the world’s major issues, such as sustainable 
development, water resources, income distribution, gender, energy, health, disasters, security, and 
technological developments, our university also contributes to the issues of Ankara and its region 
such as education, urbanization, transportation, and migration. Developing effective solutions to 
these critical problems, as well as creating innovation and value for society, humanity and nature, will 
only be possible if the university participates in bodies such as ecosystems, networks, and clusters 
created in cooperation with the public and the private sector, TEKNOKENT and other components at 
a national and an international level. In order to understand the problems and needs, and to produce 
and implement effective and applicable solutions, it is important that both those in need and the 
external stakeholders who want to be a part of the solution act in coordination and interaction. 
Priority will be given to the development of new models and to the provision of resources to support 
them in order to establish and strengthen these cooperation and interaction mechanisms.5.  DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES58
METU aims to maintain its approach of cooperation and interaction with its external stakeholders, as 
well as with all its components, by increasing the mobility and exchange of students, researchers, and 
academic personnel especially at the international level. In addition to providing its students with a 
strong vocational education, METU will benefit from the power of network-based cooperation and 
interaction with its learner-centered education approach to further develop students’ skills such as 
creativity, innovation, critical thinking, communication, and leadership.
METU attributes great importance to effective science communication and open access in sharing its 
knowledge with society and the world. For this reason, sharing knowledge with the public and the 
world in a way that covers all age segments of society and increasing cooperation and interaction 
with the alumni is another priority that will strengthen the university in all aspects.
The improvement and renovation of the physical environment of our campus, which is one of the 
most important assets of our university, within a stakeholder-participatory process that promotes 
joint efforts and innovation in a way that supports cooperation and interaction, is among our 
strategic priorities.
Strategic Priority 3: Reinforcing the Foundation
A wide experience in teaching and research in the fields of natural and social sciences is a crucial 
prerequisite for achieving the desired high impact in the fields of applied sciences and design, as 
well as interdisciplinary education and research. Strengthening the core programs within the general 
curriculum is a priority in this regard. Similarly, in order to carry out research with a high impact on 
society and international recognition, it is necessary to support the promotion of basic sciences to 
the society and theoretical research, in addition to the regulations that will increase the contribution 
of basic sciences.
Strategic Priority 4: Strengthening Resources
In order for our university to reach its goals in line with its strategic priorities, it is vital to increase and 
diversify all its resources, particularly the financial and human resources. In this respect, it is a priority 
to improve the working and living conditions along with the elimination of employment constraints 
that may damage the pioneering role of the university and the emergence of new development 
areas. On the other hand, taking initiatives to increase financial resources through activities such 
as research, development, training, and consultancy, as well as supplementing them with external 
resources such as donations and other fund-raising mechanisms in line with the core values of METU, 
are prioritized points.
With the further strengthening of human resources, faster and more effective results will be achieved 
in improving information and physical resources.
Increasing the number of qualified graduate and post-doctoral minds is an important requirement 
for increasing research and development activities, as well as innovation. Additionally, it is equally 
important to support this human power with qualified undergraduate students and alumni. Once 
these steps are successfully taken, it will be possible for our university to further progress regarding 
information, technology, and solutions for its research goals, as well as to create resources and value 
to realize its other goals.59

5.3. VALUE PRESENTATION PREFERENCES
Our university has determined its strategic priorities in the fields of success, set forth its differentiation 
strategies, and has always aimed to increase academic and scientific quality to accomplish these 
goals. It dynamically manages differentiation strategies by determining factors and preferences in 
order to improve its preferences of positioning and fields of success, as well as adding further value 
to the presentation of services.

One of the most significant strategies of METU 2023-2027 SP is to strengthen the strategic management 
of the university and the participation of administrators in the process of monitoring and evaluation.   
For this purpose, a management information system, which was among the objectives of the 2018-
2022 Strategic Plan and established within this term, will be used. Accordingly, the achievement of 
the objectives within the SP will be monitored via the Strategy Quality Management Information 
System (SKYBİS) in 6-month and annual periods, and improvement activities will be initiated and 
directed according to the identified shortcomings. 
Although the performance indicators used in monitoring have been defined to a considerable 
extent, they will be reviewed as the system operates, and any necessary changes will be made. The 
collection of data according to these indicators, as well as the derivation and presentation of reports 
will be supported by information technologies. This system will be expanded to support performance 
monitoring and evaluation at all administrative levels. Additionally, it will be able to provide data 
assistance to the activities of identifying and improving the quality problems related to the processes 
of the university.
A key step in the SP implementation is to make sure that the activities of the SPFCs are not limited 
to the SP preparation process only and that they continue to contribute during the processes of 
monitoring and evaluation. For this purpose, the duties and responsibilities of the SP preparation 
teams are shared.
Working Principles of the University Strategic Planning Support Teams (USPSTs)
Following the approval of the President of METU, the SP draft is sent to the Presidency of Strategy 
and Budget for evaluation. Necessary corrections are made in the plan in line with the issues pointed 
out in the evaluation report of the Presidency of Strategy and Budget. The plan is then put into effect 
with the approval of the President of METU. 
Monitoring is an iterative process in which quantitative and qualitative data are collected and 
analyzed on an ongoing and systematic basis, before and during implementation, in order to track 
progress regarding the goals and objectives. Monitoring processes can be defined as follows:
1. With the monitoring report that is prepared every six months and the evaluation report 
that is prepared annually, the Strategic Plan in force, together with its goals, objectives, 
and performance indicators, are evaluated. 
2. Monitoring and Evaluation Reports prepared with the coordination of the Office 
of Institutional Development and Planning and the Division of Financial Strategy 
Development are submitted to the USPB. Following the preparation of these reports, 
the Strategy Development Board holds follow-up meetings every six months and 
evaluation meetings every year.
3. Predetermined risks regarding the SP are monitored, and possible revision efforts are 
carried out when necessary.MONITORING AND
