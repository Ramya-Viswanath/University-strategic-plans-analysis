MESSAGE FROM NTU PRESIDENT STRATEGY IN A NUTSHELL   
niversities have long played a pivotal role 
in creating new knowledge, advancing 
the frontiers of human intellect, fostering 
innovation to produce economic value, and addressing 
societal needs and challenges. Consequently, 
they serve as catalysts in the preparation of 
future workforce and leadership of communities, 
organisations and countries to improve lives and 
livelihoods. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced 
the role of universities in providing critically needed 
and timely information, scientific knowhow, and 
support to policymakers and governments. 
Judging by the historical time constants of evolution 
and yardsticks of impact of universities, NTU has 
emerged as one of the leading universities in the 
world, in the relatively short time span of only several 
decades. This rapid ascent stems from the broad 
recognition that the core activities of NTU have had 
a demonstrable influence in advancing knowledge, 
talent pool and cutting-edge technologies that 
benefit national priorities and the global scientific and 
innovation ecosystem. Current and former members 
of the entire NTU community deserve significant 
credit and our gratitude for nurturing and shaping 
a young university. NTU’s current momentum and 
agility position the University well to set an ambitious 
agenda for the next stage of significant growth and 
impact through our five-year strategic plan, NTU 2025.  
Success in our NTU 2025 efforts requires ensuring 
uniformity of excellence, fostering interdisciplinary 
collaborations, and creating impactful innovation 
to benefit society. As a publicly funded institution, 
NTU has an obligation to play an important role in 
helping to address national and regional priorities. 
As an internationally acclaimed university, NTU 
has an opportunity and a platform, and indeed a 
responsibility, to help address global challenges. 
In this effort, NTU’s unique strengths will serve as 
catalysts for discoveries, discussion and discourse 
that seamlessly span a wide spectrum of disciplines 
including engineering, natural sciences, humanities, 
arts, social sciences, business, medicine, and policy.  
The NTU 2025 Strategy, or simply NTU 2025 , is the 
culmination of a year-long effort to design a plan that 
will shape the evolution of the University over the next CORE PILLARS
Education  - to nurture leaders with character, 
competence and cognitive agility
Research  - to strengthen deep disciplinary discoveries 
and high-impact interdisciplinary research 
Innovation  - to translate knowledge into enterprise 
that benefits industry and society through partnerships 
Community  - to foster a diverse, inclusive and  
cohesive communityfive years. This effort benefited from strong engagement 
and input from every part of the university community, from 
faculty and staff across all academic and administrative 
domains, and from the Board of Trustees to student leaders 
to many alumni. It also benefited significantly from the 
tireless efforts of colleagues who were members of the NTU 
2025 Strategy Task Force. I express my profound gratitude to 
all of them.  
NTU 2025 builds on the University’s unique intellectual 
assets while articulating our bold ambitions and goals for 
significantly enhancing and deploying these strengths.   
As NTU implements this plan, it will strive to play a key 
role in supporting Singapore’s national R&D priorities 
outlined in the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 
plan, and to address four of humanity’s grand challenges. 
To this end, specific initiatives, pathways, and goals have 
been established to strengthen NTU’s  four core pillars : 
education, research, innovation, and community. These 
activities will be supported through enablers that enhance 
excellence to achieve NTU 2025 goals: talent, financials  
and technology.
The plan also specifically calls for action to maximise the 
potential of NTU in areas covered by the core pillars. We 
will foster an inclusive and cohesive OneNTU  community 
grounded in shared values representing the unique and 
diverse culture of NTU and where the wellbeing of every 
member is a priority. This emphasis on building the 
OneNTU spirit requires practices and processes that ensure 
commitment to respect, fairness, wellbeing, and equal 
opportunities for all members. The plan also prioritises 
our commitment to environmental sustainability and by 
deploying our beautiful Smart Campus as a living testbed to 
translate our intellectual strengths into actionable pathways. 
Over the next five years, NTU will introduce new initiatives 
with the goal of providing a deeply transformative 
experience for our undergraduate students. A carefully 
designed interdisciplinary core curriculum will be launched 
later this year to emphasise digital literacy, teamwork, 
communication skills, and experiential learning. Through 
this effort, the University will provide greater breadth and 
depth of intellectual, social, and cultural nourishing that 
will strive to prepare NTU students for impactful service 
and global citizenship. The University will also set new 
standards for recruiting, rewarding, and recognising faculty 
and staff dedicated to teaching and research who transcend 
traditional intellectual boundaries. Finally, NTU aims to be 
at the epicentre of pioneering research, knowledge creation, 
innovation, and industry engagement by serving as the 
academic anchor in major new infrastructure projects and 
ecosystems planned for development around our campuses. 
This document is a summary of our ambitious agenda for NTU 
2025. I very much look forward to working with our talented 
and committed community of scholars, students, staff and 
alumni to bring NTU to new heights in the service of humanity. 
I invite you all to participate in this extraordinary journey.
