3ADVANCING OUR 
UNIVERSITY
This strategic plan, The Virginia Tech Difference:      
Advancing Beyond Boundaries, was developed in 
collaboration with faculty, staff, students, and alumni   
across our colleges, institutes, offices, and campuses,   
and shaped by partners and employers.
The Virginia Tech Difference: Advancing Beyond 
Boundaries guides initial steps to achieving our long-term 
BEYOND BOUNDARIES  future as a comprehensive research 
land-grant university by affirming our vision, mission, and 
core values; defining university priorities; and outlining 
goals and initial milestones to achieve each priority.

THE VIRGINIA TECH DIFFERENCE:
ADVANCING BEYOND BOUNDARIES4
VIRGINIA TECH 
BEYOND BOUNDARIES
Led by President Tim Sands, BEYOND BOUNDARIES: A 
2047 VISION culminated in a generational visioning process 
to position Virginia Tech as an internationally recognized 
land-grant university that strategically addresses the 
challenges and opportunities presented by the changing 
higher education landscape. BEYOND BOUNDARIES  
identified three guiding concepts to transform Virginia 
Tech into the university of the future: VT-shaped Discovery                
(purpose-driven discovery), Communities of Discovery 
(campus, regional, and global engagement hubs), and Nexus 
of Discovery (transdisciplinary discovery). 
Integral to this transformation is Virginia Tech’s continued 
commitment to UT PROSIM (THAT I MAY SERVE) , academic 
excellence, and world-class research. In addition, engaging 
the whole person; innovation; and affordability and 
accessibility are guiding principles that have informed the 
strategic planning process and initial steps toward achieving 
Virginia Tech’s BEYOND BOUNDARIES  vision.
5
The strategic planning process involved significant 
iteration, engagement, and collaboration with the university 
community. Throughout this comprehensive and inclusive 
process, the Virginia Tech community was engaged to 
discuss initial and evolving drafts and gather and incorporate 
feedback on the strategic planning framework. Strategic 
planning materials were continually updated throughout this 
process to reflect iterative, ongoing feedback.
These conversations and feedback sessions included 
participants from colleges, departments, institutes, offices, 
student groups, commissions, committees, associations, 
alumni groups, university leadership, and the Board of 
Visitors. Feedback discussions involved participants 
from various disciplines and levels, and took place across 
geographic locations including Blacksburg, Roanoke, 
Alexandria, Arlington, and Falls Church.  
Feedback session participants provided more than 1,000 
written, digital, or verbal forms of feedback. Data was 
continually synthesized and analyzed to shape the mission, 
vision, core values, priorities, goals, and initial milestones.SHAPED BY OUR

THE VIRGINIA TECH DIFFERENCE:
ADVANCING BEYOND BOUNDARIES 24LOOKING TOWARD 
THE FUTURE
A core component of Beyond Boundaries seeks to grow a 
culture of “continuous planning” at Virginia Tech. Continuous 
strategic planning involves monitoring goals, metrics, and 
milestones for existing priorities; identifying, developing, and 
advancing new strategic priorities; and ensuring a culture of 
self-evaluation, innovation, agility, and adaptibility. 
As Virginia Tech builds upon this strategic planning framework 
and develops a culture of continuous planning across the 
university, this framework will be a university-level guide for 
colleges, institutes, offices, departments, and units as they 
develop their respective strategies and plans to advance 
institutional priorities.
Feasibility studies will inform prioritization, implementation, 
and the development of processes to identify and incubate 
new ideas and increase decision-making transparency and 
efficiency throughout the institution. Key university leaders 
will be identified to champion specific initiatives, and a 
collaborative, partnership-driven continuous planning process 
will help Virginia Tech achieve milestones and advance its 
BEYOND BOUNDARIES  vision.
