INSA Lyon's action plan 
The initial action plan included 26 actions, 50% of  which were completed. Meetings of the monitoring c ommittee have the plan by providing more details 
on certain actions, which have been broken down int o sub-actions (e.g. sub-actions 5.2; 5.3). These wo rking meetings also led to the emergence of three n ew 
actions to enable the institution to improve the ro les and responsibilities within research laboratori es. 
The current action plan therefore comprises : 
Total actions and sub -actions  42 = 29 actions + 13 s ub -actions  
New actions and sub - actions  5 
Action cancelled  1 
Late actions or sub -actions - extended deadline  3
