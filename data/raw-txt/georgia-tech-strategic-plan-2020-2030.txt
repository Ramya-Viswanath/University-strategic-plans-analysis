The Georgia Tech Strategic Plan – The Next 10 Years   
Dear Yellow Jackets :  
I am pleased to share the new strategic plan for the Georgia Institute of Technology. This plan presents 
our shared vision for the next decade . It is grounded in our commitment to developing leaders who 
advance technology and improve the human condition , and  is driven by a set of ambitious goals and 
bold actions  to grow the impact we have in the world .  
We envision a n institution that leverages its unmatched scale and resources to address the most 
crucial challenges of our time . An engine of  innovation and entrepreneurship that helps position  our 
city and state as vibrant hub s of economic opportunity and dynamism . A global institution that 
develops committed, global leaders who can  build  bridges of collaboration around the world. An 
inclusive academic community committed to expanding access so that more voices, more minds, and 
more perspectives can contribute to creating a better future .  
Our world today is wrought with complex challenges that will define the future of our communities, 
our nation, and our species on this planet : how to power a growing world economy without heating 
our planet beyond repair and without harming the ecosystems our li ves depend on ; how to prov ide 
access to food, clean water, education , and healthcare to a world population that has doubled during 
my own lifetime and will add another billion by the end of this decade ; how to combat social 
inequities, racial injustice , and gender discrimination ; how to strengthen our democracy, resolve 
conflict, maintain peace , and defend ourselves against emerging security threats ; how to prepare the 
world to fend off the next pandemic .  
Because of our scale and the caliber of the tale nt we attract and develop, Georgia Tech is in a unique 
position to respond to these challenges. Our graduates drive innovation in business, government , and 
academia ; they lead transformative companies and create new ones ; and they influence the thinking of 
other leaders in the private and public sectors. Our faculty consistently deliver breakthroughs in 
science and technology, they critically assess the potential and risk of new technologies, and the y 
shape the minds of current and future leaders .  

 2 Our plan is to amplify that impact by expanding access to more talented individuals of more 
backgrounds, ensuring that our graduates are equipped to lead and make a difference and that our 
research responds to questions of great consequence, empowering innovators to create new solutions 
and companies to make them accessible , and opening the doors of technology and innovation to 
everyone .  
The priorities articulated in this strategic plan are firmly grounded in our main core value.  Our students 
are our to p priority,  and that commitment shines through in our goals.  We strive for excellence , thrive 
on diversity  and celebrate collaboration . We champion innovation , on our campus and around us.  We 
nurture the well -being  of our entire community and are committed to ethical behavior and 
responsible stewardship .  
Georgia Tech developed this 10 -year plan through a highly inclusive process involving more than 5,700 
individuals, a 6 4-member steering committee, and six working groups comprised of 250 students, 
faculty, staff, and alumni. This plan belongs to all of us. And it is up to all of us to make it a reality. As 
we like to say around here: We can do that!

 3 Letter from the co-chairs   
Colleagues : 
In Fall 2019 , President Cabrera challenged us to bring together the entire Georgia Tech community and 
dream big. We did.  Thousands of participants, including more than 2,600 students , attended meetings, 
workshops , and informational sessions or webinars , sharing their perspectives and dreams for Georgia 
Tech.  The work continued outside of the meetings , under the guidance of the 6 4-member steering 
committee.  Ideas were shared, discussed,  refined , and built upon to produce a plan that is aspirational, 
inspirational, and because we’re Georgia Tech, attainable.  This is OUR plan.  It is specific but  also 
flexible enough to leave room for unanticipated opportunities and even disruption.  
 
In the middle of designing this plan, we were all faced with a pandemic that demanded our attention in  
safely  operating  a major research university while compelling us to develop solutions to save lives 
worldwide. This strategic plan takes aim at these very kinds of issues. No matter how great the 
challenge, Georgia Tech is working hard to innovate, lead, and collaborate in creating solutions to the 
world’s most complex problems.  
 
We are a technological research university . It is in our name and an important part of our mission, and 
yet we offer so much more.  Our students develop their leadership capabilities by applying a full 
spectrum of skills and knowledge acquired through their Georgia Tech education. Our students gain 
holistic learning across science, technology, engineering, math, arts, humanities,  business, and social 
sciences.  Through greater interdisciplinary and experiential learning experiences , we will nurture their 
creativity and inspire them to become ethically g rounded, globally aware leaders.  And, we are 
committed to lifetime learning , from assisting K -12 in STEM  education  to partnering with business to 
develop graduate degrees and professional education.  Progress and Service — for all.  
Our new mission statement , our ambitious vision, and our actionable goals and objectives all set the 
stage for carrying out our motto of Progress and Service to amplify our impact, champion innovation, 
connect globally, expand access, cultivate well -being, and lead by example . As we mobilize this plan, 
we will expect measurable progress through a culture of inclusive excellence and a cadence of 
measurement and accountability.    
We expect that this living document will be reviewed and refined each year, with ongoing evaluation of 
our progress.  We also anticipate that Colleges, Schools , and programs will develop their own plans to 
define ways that each division of the Institute can bring the new strategic plan to life. We look forward 
to your ongoing participation in that process.  It has been our privilege to work alongside so many of 
you in designing Georgia Tech’s new strategic plan for the future. Our future — together.

 4 The Georgia Tech Mission  
 The Georgia Institute of Technology is a public research university established by the state of Georgia 
in Atlanta in 1885 and committed to   
developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition .  
  
Our Motto   
Progress and Service   
  
  
  
 5 The Georgia Tech Vision 2020 -2030   
Progress and Service for All  
Over the next decade, Georgia Tech will be come  an example of inclusive innovation, a leading 
technological research university of unmatched scale, relentlessly committed to serving the public 
good ; breaking new ground in addressing the biggest local, national, and global challenges  and 
opportunities  of our time ; making technology broadly accessible ; and developing exceptional , 
principled  leaders from all backgrounds ready to produce novel ideas and create solutions with real 
human impact.    
We will deliver on this vision by building an outstanding  and diverse community of learning, discovery, 
and creation in an inclusive and collaborative environment focused on innovation and access. We will 
develop healthy and vibrant learning environments that support holistic learning and personal growth. 
We will be  leaders in educational innovation and develop a global learning platform of unmatched 
impact and scale to support learners throughout their life journeys. We will challenge ourselves to 
push the boundaries of research while focusing on the most consequent ial questions and problems 
faced by humanity. And we will act as a creative engine that will position our city and our state as 
examples of inclusive entrepreneurship and innovation.   
Progress and Service   
Since its founding in 1885 by an act of the state government, the Georgia Institute of Technology has 
become a leading global research university, a strategic economic development asset for Georgia, and 
an essential element of the national system of science and technology. Driven by a commitment to 
Progress and Service, Georgia Tech has produced extraordinary engineers, scientists, entrepreneurs, 
and leaders in business, government, academia and nonprofits, who have had a transformative impact 
locally and around the world.    
Georgia Tech brings toget her scholars  and innovators  from a wide variety of fields driven by the idea 
that technology has the power to improve the human condition. We don’t just develop technology for 
technology’s sake. We advance technology and the science that supports it, and w e find novel ways to 
leverage and deploy it, to change our world for the better. And we develop leaders who think critically 
about the problems we face and the technology at our disposal, find new solutions, and create value 
for the greater good.    
Technol ogy has helped humanity achieve a standard of living that was unimaginable just a few decades 
ago.  Technology has contributed to the reduction in  extreme poverty  and hunger ; to giving  more 
people access to basic education, water , and sanitation ; to helping people  live longer, better  lives  than 
ever before .   
Yet, while we celebrate these achievements, we recognize that the progress has been uneven, that 
some of the solutions have created their own challenges , and that unforeseen e vents like the Covid -19 
pandemic can delay and even reverse decades of progress . Indeed, much remains to be done  —around 
 6 the world and at home. We need to find new ways to create economic opportunity and enable social 
mobility; build more livable communities; provide affordable housing and sustainable transportation; 
make education, healthcare, clean water , and energy availa ble to everyone; combat old and emerging 
diseases; and keep us all safe and free. And we need to do that while combatting climate change, 
reducing the stress on our planet , and protecting ourselves against the threat of new infectious 
diseases .  
Technology  will be essential in addressing these challenges, but only if it is grounded in a critical 
understanding of its social, economic, environmental , and cultural context and if available where 
needed. In order to not only advance technology but  deepen our und erstanding of the human 
condition and find novel ways to improve it, our research and teaching approach incorporates 
perspectives not just from engineering , and physical and biological sciences , but from a multitude of 
disciplines: social and behavioral sciences, humanities , business, policy, arts and design , and other 
fields. We need to educate talented scientists and engineers,  and also  designers, innovators , business 
leaders , and humanists who can deepen our understanding and shape our thinking about the most 
consequential issues that we face  — the aspects of the human condition that need improving.  
  
Embracing All Voices   
The magnitude of the challenges and opportunities we face also demands that we empower , include , 
and engage  more people, backgrounds , and perspectives in the process of learning, discovery, and 
creation. Over the years, we have learned that progress needs all voices to be heard, all minds to be 
cultivated, and all talent to b e empowered. One of the most transformative figures in American 
history , Atlanta native Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said that everyone can be great because everyone can 
serve. At Georgia Tech, we also know that everyone can contribute to Progress and Servi ce because 
everyone can learn. If technology is to work for all people, it must be developed by all people and be 
accessible to all people.   
But while talent is equally distributed, the opportunity to learn and grow is often not. Women, racial 
and ethnic m inorities,  individuals from rural communities  and from low-income  families are still 
underrepresented at Georgia Tech and other leading technological universities, thus limiting the scope 
of perspectives shaping our future.  Underrepresentation also exists among faculty and staff roles, 
underscoring our responsibility to remove barriers of access , to dismantle underlying causes of 
institutional exclusion , and ensure that talented individuals from all backgrounds  across our 
community  can contribute to our shared mission. The story of our city — the epicenter of a movement 
that restored basic civil rights to millions of people across the nation — demonstrates how much 
stronger we are when we embrace diversity of people and ideas . As champions of innovation in our 
local economy, we will strive to help Atlanta and the global Georgia Tech community become examples 
of vibrant, inclusive entrepreneurship.   
Strong Local Roots, Broad Global Reach   
Originally established to help industrialize Georgia and a war -torn American South, Georgia Tech 
became a critical element in Atlanta’s emergence as a city of national and worldwide prominence: a 
 7 global transportation hub, a site of commerce, the home of i conic business giants, and an incubator of 
transformative social and cultural movements. Atlanta has , indeed , become one of the most globally 
connected cities in the world and a leading international meeting place — as it memorably showed 
when it hosted th e Centennial Olympic Games in 1996.    
Like its home city, Georgia Tech has become a globally recognized  and a reliable  partner in supporting 
international collaboration, education, commerce, and research in complex issues that affect us all. 
Those collabor ations and partnerships have demonstrated that global relevance is not at odds with 
local impact. Exposure to other cultures prepares our students to lead in the global economy. The 
cultural and demographic diversity , and the nature of the issues that we f ace in our immediate 
community , offer a unique ground for testing solutions that can set an example for other parts of the 
world. And the exceptional talent we attract from around the world positions Georgia Tech to make 
unique contributions to local and g lobal problems, build strong bridges to the world, and strengthen 
the global competitiveness of our state.     
The pandemic of 2020  has highlighted that the most consequential challenges we face are global in 
nature and require global collaboration and solu tions. It has also show n how essential technology is for 
supporting collaboration at the local and global levels, for the rapid diffusion of solutions, and, very 
specially, for the delivery of learning. Georgia Tech’s leadership in learning technology and innovation  
—which has produced , among other tangible results , the world’s largest online master’s program in 
computer science  — proved instrumental in our ability to deliver education despite the disruption . It 
demonstrated how technology can help  create a truly global network of learning and innovation  and 
expand access . But i t also highlighted  the gaps in technological access for people in rural and low -
income communities.   
Creating a Better Future   
Georgia Tech has been an engine of Progress and Service for more than 135 years and is ready to play 
an even greater role going forward. With humility , and yet great confidence in our history and our 
unique capabilities, Georgia Tech is redefining what it means to be a leading public technological 
research university in this new era, committed to empowering people of all backgrounds and to 
integrating our resources across disciplines to create a better future for our community  — locally, 
nationally, and glo bally.  
  
 8 Our Strategy Guided by Values, Reinforced Through Culture   
Our values are foundational in everything we do. They are our lodestar. Values define who we are and 
who we aspire to be as a community. They help us make  decisions. They refer to an inclusive “we” and 
apply to  every member of the Georgia Tech  community — student, faculty, staff, alumni , and affiliate. 
No matter the role, the values are meant to guide our priorities  every day , to help us focus on our 
important, shared mission . 
Students are our top priority.  We are educators first and foremost, committed to developing leaders 
who advance technology and improve the human condition. We measure our success by the 
achievements of our students and the impact of our graduates in improving the lives of others.  
We str ive for excellence.  We strive to be among the best at what we do and to set high expectations 
for each of us individually and for our community as a whole. The expectation of excellence, which is 
instrumental to our ability to have a meaningful impact in the world, extends to our teaching, our 
research and creative endeavors, our athletic programs, and our operations.     
We thrive on diversity.  We see diversity of backgrounds and perspectives as essential to learning, 
discovery , and creation. We strive to remove barriers to access and success , and to build an inclusive 
community where people of all backgrounds have the opportunity to learn and contribute to our 
mission.    
We celebrate collaboration. We enable and celebrate collab oration across disciplines and 
perspectives, between units and departments, and with other organizations at home and around the 
world. We value the contributions of all members of our community, promote civil and respectful 
discourse, and help one another succeed.    
We champion innovation.  We inspire, empower, and provide the resources and environment for 
innovative ideas  and solutions  to flourish. We welcome new concepts and approaches that lead to 
creative ideas and solutions.    
We safeguard freedom of in quiry and expression.  We protect the freedom of all members of our 
community to ask questions, seek truth, and express their views. We cherish diversity of ideas as 
necessary for learning, discovery, scholarship, and creativity.    
We nurture the well -being  of our community. We strive to build a healthy and vibrant environment 
that helps our students and every member of our community grow holistically and develop the self -
awareness, knowledge, and practices necessary to pursue healthy, purposeful, fulfilling  lives.     
We act ethically.  We hold one another to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct. 
We are transparent and accountable , and strive to earn and maintain the public trust.      
We are responsible stewards.  We are careful stewards of  the resources we are entrusted with and 
strive to be an example of sustainability, efficiency, respect, and responsibility.   
 9  Six Areas of Strategic Focus   
Defining our strategy for the next decade requires focus on a select number of key priorities.  In order 
to achieve our vision for the future, we will pursue meaningful and measurable progress in six strategic 
focus areas:    
• Amplify Impact:   Embrace our power as agents of change for the public good and generate 
talent, ideas, and solution s with unmatched impact and scale to help define and address the 
most critical problems of our time, locally and globally.   
 
• Champion Innovation:   Champion our leadership position as an engine of innovation and 
entrepreneurship, and collaborate with other public and private actors to create economic 
opportunity and mobility and position Atlanta and Georgia as examples of inclusive innovation.    
 
• Connect Globally:   Strengthen our role as a convener of worldwide collaboration, and build a 
global learnin g network to expand our reach and amplify our impact.     
 
• Expand Access :  Empower people of all backgrounds and stages of life to learn and contribute to 
technological and human progress.

The Georgia Tech Graduate   
The Georgia Tech graduate will be a creative, ethical, globally minded , technologically sophisticated 
innovator and problem -solver committed to making a positive difference in their communit ies, their 
organizations, and the world.  
  
  
  
 
 10 Our Priority  Goals   
Our six strategic focus areas  each have a priority goal with  four to six key objectives  that describe the 
expected outcomes we anticipate as we implement this plan . The Moving Into Action section  describes 
our initial ideas for strategies to achieve those objectives . The Tracking Our Progress section indicates  
the metrics we will rely on to evalua te and communicate our progress.  A series of  implementation 
teams will develop  more detailed plan s, strategies , and targets . 
These goals set the strategic stage for the next 10 years , with an appreciation for the magnitude of the 
change that has occurred since we began writing this plan in late 2019. The lessons of 2020 will endure 
for many years to come. Our lives, expectations, and needs have been affected by the pandemic, the 
economic downturn  that ensued, and a moment of reckoning about the racial injustices that still exist 
in our society . While the direction marked by  this plan is intended to be long -lasting, our path to 
navigate the next few years  will likely evolve.   
Across this plan , we have intentionally adopt ed the pronoun  “we.” These goals are not intended to 
apply to a specific unit, College , or School. They apply to all members of the Georgia Tech community , 
which includes all staff, faculty  and researchers , our alumni , and partners . Also,  references to “all 
students” are meant to include all students: residential  and online, graduate  and undergraduate. Any 
reference to “all learners” includes all degree and non -degree learning program participants.

 22 Conclusion  
We started with appreciative inquiry, asking groups and individuals what they see as Georgia Tech’s 
strengths, and challenging them to “dream big.” That led to the development of our narrative, vision 
and mission, strategic themes, and values and beliefs i n a plan for the next decade. It is interesting that 
Georgia Tech’s last strategic plan was designed during a global recession, while much of this one was 
finalized during a pandemic. For more than 135 years , the people of Georgia Tech have dared to 
imagin e and then create solutions for a better future  no matter their current circumstances . The 
innovative leadership continues  — for Progress and Service  for all.
