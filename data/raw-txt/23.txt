our direction and how we will get there. 
Our Strategy sets out our long-term ambitions for the School

collective vision. 
With a focus on long-term planning, we will effectively 
manage the School’s finances to deliver our vision and 
ambitions. We will bring transparency to financial decision-
making, spending our money well, without waste and in line 
with our values. We will manage financial risk and facilitate 
continued investment in our people environment and 
infrastructure. The School of Dentistry Strategy and Vision  aligns with the 
University Strategic Plan and its Vision to be a world-leading, 
research-excellent, educationally outstanding university, 
driven by creativity and curiosity, which fulfils its social, 
cultural, and economic obligations to Cardiff, Wales, the 
UK, and the world. The University’s Strategic Themes and 
Enabling Strategies are referenced throughout our Strategy 
to highlight synergy and  common goals.
