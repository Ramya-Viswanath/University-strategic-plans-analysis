Strategic Plan 2019-20221.1 Background
The University’s strategic planning for the 
2019-2022 four-year period was motivated by the need to combine its strong and con-solidated tradition with challenging new objectives able to satisfy an increasingly complex and multi-variable scenario, under rapid and constant evolution, fashioned by digital transformation and environmental sustainability processes, as well as those of an economic-financial and regulatory na-ture, of which Vita-Salute San Raffaele Uni-versity (hereinafter UniSR) is an integral and interacting part. 
The explicit recognition of the Universi-
ty’s educational role within the “society of knowledge” and the change of Governance (a new Board of Directors was appointed in June 2018), spurred a thorough review of the University’s strategic lines of development, broken down into the following strategic macro-objectives: Student Happiness, Inter-
nationalisation and Digital Transformation. 
Following an intense review process invol-
ving all key areas of the University, the stra-tegic planning (2019-2022) includes, in ad-dition to the Mission, the declination of the main promise of value that emblemises and differentiates UniSR: “Innovating through 
knowledge”. The University’s strategic map is broken down into domains (Teaching, Research, Third Mission, Infrastructures and general services, Human Resources).Within each of these domains, the strategic objectives and corresponding operational actions that will make it possible to imple-ment them and to guarantee the on-going pursuit of the Quality objective have been defined. Being transverse, the strategic ma-cro-objectives (Student Happiness, Interna-tionalisation and Digital Transformation) will 
impact all of the domains and, consequently, all the strategic objectives.
Main steps of planning:
• Interpretation of three new strategic macro-objectives;
• Definition of the main promise of value to be added to the University’s Mission;
• Study of the context in question (iden-tification of the change drivers and ex-ternally-conducted functional analysis of the way our University is perceived by the main stakeholders, in terms of both brand equity and student journey);
• For the various domains, the illustra-tion of the strategic objectives and cor-responding operational actions, taking Quality policy into due consideration;
• For each individual action, the definition of the general time-line, the overall bu-dget, the drivers and Index/Target.
[...] in addition to the Mission,
the declination of the main promise of value that emblemises and differentiates UniSR: “Innovating through knowledge” 
Strategic Plan 2019-20228
UniSR operates along four main lines:
• a plurality of outlooks united by a com-
mon interest in the human being in all its aspects; 
• the entwining of disciplines to form a shared method; 
• focussing on the present challenges fa-cing research and knowledge; 
• the preparation of professionals ready to deal with the needs of contemporary society and able to make a contribution towards a more prosperous future.The core of UniSR’s Mission remains its at-tention regarding the essential dimensions of the human being: body, mind and spirit (studied by the Faculty of Medicine, the Fa-culty of Psychology and the Faculty of Philo-sophy, respectively) and, therefore, the will to answer the question “Quid est homo?”.
The University strives to establish a dialogue 
between science and cultural traditions with the objective of pursuing an on-going and unending renewal of knowledge in all fields, through the adoption of a “holistic outlook” 
1.2 The University’s Mission
9
Strategic Plan 2019-2022embodied by a daily environment that is rich 
in stimuli, able to offer a multitude of oppor-tunities for the exploration and exchange of ideas, and to guarantee a broad and diversi-fied human experience able to prepare young people for the world of employment in a completely new way.
It is to this “interdisciplinary” spirit that the 
pluralistic, inclusive and multicultural voca-tion that the University intends to consoli-date and expand belongs. 

Strategic Plan 2019-202210
1.3 “Innovating through Knowledge”
The transition from the “information so-
ciety” associated with the process of tech-nological transformation, to the “knowle-dge society” that expands its perimeter by embracing social, ethical and political issues by encouraging the sharing and diffusion of knowledge as part of an inclusive outlook (knowledge as a common good, made avai-lable to the whole community), has led to a gradual change in the nature of universi-ty education, the way it is provided and the University’s role in society.
The recognition of the University’s educa-
tional task as an Institution attributed the responsibility of focussing on the human being as the producer and vehicle of knowle-dge, has urged UniSR to intensify its efforts to develop an “innovation culture” by cre-ating a more dynamic and interactive lear-ning environment where digital technology becomes a support tool, able to promote new forms of thought organisation, new ways of learning and alternative forms of interper-sonal communication and cooperation.
The University therefore intends to accept 
the challenges of a very exciting moment in time for the university world that pre-sents greater opportunities for innovation than in the past, due partly to the evolution in the expectations of its main stakeholders.  More specifically: • Students: whose expectations are de-termined by common social transfor-mations within globalisation and can be summarised as the “shorter attention span” (different biological rhythm) of the new generations compared to pre-vious generations. Therefore, aspects such as the architecture of the facili-ty, namely the design and organisation of spaces (teaching rooms, study rooms, libraries, etc.) or the planning of time, intended as the programming of les-sons and exams, can have a positive or negative impact on student performan-ce and are considered an “added value”. Overall they favour communication and support new learning and teaching mo-dels that require a switch from lecturing where the student’s involvement is pri-marily passive (summative assessment) to a new form of teaching characterised by greater student-teacher interaction, allowing the former to constantly iden-tify their strengths and weaknesses and the latter to be able to intervene in those areas in which their students are wea-kest (formative assessment).
• The working world: the expectation is that new graduates receive an educa-tion that does not merely specialise in the chosen subject but that also provides transverse skills (soft skills), by impro-ving the methods used to help students recognise their aptitudes and develop their self-knowledge and -perception in relation to the world of employment. 
• State: in addition to responsibility and transparency, Universities are expected to be able to demonstrate their ability to pursue excellent results in all domains (Teaching, Research, Third Mission).
In line with the evolution of the expecta-tions of its main stakeholders and as a con-sequence of the importance attributed to knowledge as a resource for individual and community life, the University summari-ses in the “Innovating through knowledge” 
principle its main promise of value, to-gether with its original vocation of answe-ring the question “Quid est Homo?”.

2.  The Context – Market And Position 
13
Strategic Plan 2019-2022Context analysis is the first step towards the definition of UniSR’s strategic planning, as it 
makes it possible to understand the scenario in which the institution operates.The University therefore deemed it necessary to identify a starting point on to which it could subsequently graft the strategic map of objectives/actions, on the one hand, by identifying the main factors that influence the ecosystem of the Education sector (change drivers) and, 
on the other, by performing a thorough analysis of the perception that the main stakeholders have of the University in terms of both internal and external brand equity, and the student journey.
2.1 Change Drivers
Two phenomena that affect the whole of the context within which the University opera-tes are: first and foremost, digital transfor-mation, i.e. the ability of new and emerging technologies to modify operating methods in all domains. It provides an opportunity to improve and redefine the university expe-rience as a whole, also with regard to the expertise of students, who are increasingly more enlightened, better connected, digital contaminators.Today’s students are the primary users of digital transformation and, as such, they are and will increasingly be receptive to evalua-ting the approach universities have to change.
Secondly, environmental sustainability, in 
line with the challenges set by the UN’s 2030 Agenda for sustainable development accor-ding to which universities are called on to play an active part, not merely by improving the facilities and services they offer, but also, as a reference point for the scenario and area they operate in as part of a “glocal” outlook, 
as a significant opportunity to strengthen their relationship and communication with the rest of society.
The phenomena described above are occur-
ring at a moment in time that has witnes-sed the birth of a single university education market that has increasingly urged students to explore new contacts and consider periods spent abroad as an essential educational experience that is decisive for access to the world of employment.
Together with this, another factor that be-
longs to the context stems from the fact that UniSR, as a private university, needs to gua-rantee sustainable resource management in the short, medium and long term through the constant monitoring of its positive ba-lance sheet. 
Today’s students are
the primary users
of digital transformation

2.2 The perception of Stakeholders
 The need to conduct external research originates from the need to obtain better self-aware-
ness and acquire a functional analysis to be used as a basis for the planning and development of the University’s strategic plan. The study was conducted on a number of subject targets, as shown in the table below:

Strategic Plan 2019-2022Three different questionnaires were devised for each category, in order to explore both the 
distinctive and characterising issues of each segment and issues common to the entire Uni-SR universe. The interviews were distributed in proportion to both the 3 targets interviewed (Enrolled students, Graduates, Erasmus and Placements) and for each faculty, to obtain the various sub-samples. The redemption rates were good and proportionate to the number of students involved.
The analysis shows that the University is well known, especially amongst prospective students 
considering the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery: word-of-mouth amongst friends and fa-mily (especially youngsters at university) and consultation of the University’s website are the two main sources of brand awareness.The opinion of secondary school teachers regarding the choice of university career also re-mains an important factor for youngsters, especially those intending to enrol with the Facul-ty of Philosophy.

Internally, the University is considered a cutting-edge, modern and innovative centre of 
excellence, with an outstanding reputation amongst those who know it, thanks to its tea-ching and educational content, the way learning is organised and the teaching method used (the only one of its kind in Italy), the quality of the teaching body, the research activities and, no less importantly, the university’s connections with IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, which represents a differentiating element of the student journey (students have the chance to take 
an active part in ward and laboratory life).UniSR is primarily known abroad thanks to its international partnerships and represents a desirable destination for those who wish to come and study in Italy, and, in particular, in Milan. However, it would appear that the perceptive driver of foreign students still varies gre-atly, especially with regard to the type and duration of the experience. 
The University therefore intends to continue pursuing the development of an innovati-
ve educational product and services that are increasingly tailored to meet student needs, placing special attention on the multicultural factor and the creation of an internatio-nal-friendly environment.

3. The strategic macro-objectives 
19
Strategic Plan 2019-2022Student Happiness: the first of the Univer-
sity’s strategic macro-objectives and the transverse declination of its human-centred and comprehensive approach; it consists in 
putting students at the centre of its acti-vities by making them the focal point of all its commitments, in terms of both teaching and the services provided, in order to create a favourable and inclusive environment, by advocating innovative teaching and learning methods, as part of a vision of curricular in-terdisciplinarity and approach to the world of employment. 
Internationalisation: the University’s se-
cond strategic macro-objective regards its 
ability to attract and recruit resources (hu-man capital and financial contributions), develop international relations and establish partnerships with leading universities abro-ad, as part of a vision of comprehensive in-ternationalisation
1. 
As we are increasingly required to operate in international contexts, the University’s internationalisation process cannot be li-mited to recruiting foreign students or in-creasing the number of foreign study pro-grammes, but must also embrace common goals involving the whole institution and all its stakeholders (governance, the faculty, the administrative body and students) and must reflect a series of activities and strategies to be adopted in order to respond to the gene-ral process of globalisation, which inevitably involves multiculturality.
Internationalisation therefore becomes an 
essential element of the University’s deve-lopment policy.1“Comprehensive internationalization is a commitment, confirmed through action, to infuse internationaland comparative perspectives throughout the teaching, research, and service missions of higher education. It shapes institutional ethos and values and touches the entire higher education enterprise.It is essential that it is embraced by institutional leadership, governance, faculty, students, and all academic service and support units”.(Hudzik 2011).

Strategic Plan 2019-202220
The basic concept is that the 
University develops and offers the educational experience,and that students “interpret”it and determine its reputation, thereby becoming advocates of the University

21
Strategic Plan 2019-2022Figure 3:
From experienceto reputation– Source: CEGOS FranceDigital Transformation: the third strategic macro-objective regards the University’s involvement in a digital transformation pro-cess, considered as the adoption of techno-logically-modern approaches to teaching and research, as well as the digitalisation of administrative processes, in order to provide a highly qualified and qualifying educational product supported by an efficient organisa-tion and services.From this standpoint, Digital Transformation represents a radical and clean break from the past, one that is necessarily disruptive, as it does not merely mean investing in IT, but also directing the entire University towards cultural, organisational, social, creative and managerial changes that are associated with and facilitated by the use of applications and digital devices. In other words, the underlying concept is to create, by means of technological inno-vation, a “Digital campus” able to meet the requirements of a new paradigm, which is represented by the acronym “ATAWAD” (any time, anywhere, any device)
2.2“Atawad”: constantly connected mobile devices are ubiquitous and available to all; social media have become the most widespread means of communication, the availabilityof APPs, the power of in-cloud calculation and “always on” technology are the technological factors that have most guided the change,at a momentin time characterised by the progressive simplificationof human work due to the introduction of technologies based on artificial intelligence.In line with the University’s Quality policy, the macro-objectives described above corre-late with the following fundamental princi-ples:• a “person-centred” approach, in order 
to guarantee continuing interaction with and satisfaction of the needs of all the individuals involved (students, teachers, technical and administrative staff);
• the adoption of a Comprehensive appro-
ach, i.e. one that is inclusive and regards the entire university (from recruitment policy, through to staff, the student body and life on campus).
The basic concept is that the University develops and offers the educational expe-rience, and that students “interpret” it and determine its reputation, thereby beco-ming advocates of the University.

4. Executive Summary
23
Strategic Plan 2019-20224.1 Teaching
In academic circles and educational faci-
lities, for a long time there has been talk of the need to review conventional teaching methods, which constitutes not only an un-precedented challenge for universities, but also an opportunity for innovation.
Attempts to deal with a given discipline in a 
systematic and exhaustive manner through conventional courses has led to a significant increase in the teaching load, above all in the form of classroom lessons, which has de-tracted time and energy from more practical and interactive forms of learning.
The recognition of the limits of conventional 
teaching together with the shorter attention span observed in new student cohorts com-pared to previous generations (attention span shrinkage) has urged the University to con-
sider the need to review conventional tea-ching, by privileging innovative approaches to teaching able to combine learning, practi-ce and application and to constantly monitor students’ level of learning and/or any critical aspects observed in itinere.
In addition, the teaching of modern medicine 
must necessarily dedicate special attention to the interpersonal relationship between doctor and patient. UniSR therefore recogni-ses the importance of offering its students structured learning sessions that guarantee the acquisition of the skills needed to learn the basic techniques for interacting with pa-tients.

25
Strategic Plan 2019-20224.2 Research
In the “knowledge society”, Universities 
represent for Research a privileged “labo-ratory”, in that they are able to put their facilities at the service of the creation of va-lue which is, in turn, instrumental to social, economic and cultural development.
UniSR therefore believes that Research must 
develop as a central and fundamental aspect of the University in order to guarantee hi-gh-quality scientific production, capable of making a decisive contribution to the crea-tion of common value by processing concep-ts and projects, not only within Italy, but also in European and international scenarios. With regard to its strategic planning (2019 - 2022), the University intends to continue to guarantee “interdisciplinary” Research, by pursuing mechanisms that reinforce the forms of cooperation and internal and exter-nal sharing of resources and know-how, that takes place freely and autonomously, that is based on a code of behavioural integrity (Re-search Integrity) that maintains its reliability and reproducibility and that is open and sha-red (Open science/data sharing).

4.3 The Third Mission
In addition to Teaching and Research, the University pursues a Third Mission, in other words, 
it strives to favour the promotion and transmission of knowledge in order to make a contri-bution to the social, cultural and economic development of Society. 
More specifically, on campus, UniSR extensively promotes Third Mission activities through 
both the development and promotion of Research promotion activities and Public Engagement.
With regard to the Strategic Plan, UniSR intends to increase its commitment also through the 
creation of an internal organisation dedicated to the systematic collection, on-going moni-toring and assessment of Third Mission activities, for planning and continuous improvement purposes.

4.4 Infrastructures and general services
UniSR puts the student at the centre of its 
initiatives aimed at improving teaching, research and administrative processes and relations with the local area and encoura-ges participation and involvement in life on campus. The University is convinced that it is essential to dedicate the greatest possible attention to the activities that accompany student life, students’ needs and expecta-tions, as well as their wellness throughout their university careers.This attention is declined into services ai-med at improving the continuous interaction between students and university staff (both academic and non), in order to provide the most effective answer to their different ne-eds and, at the same time, to optimise and improve support services.
UniSR also intends to do its utmost to redu-
ce the environmental impact of its activities, in order to provide an active response to the challenges set by the Global Risks Report 2019, which puts extreme meteorological condi-tions, the inability to take action regarding climate change, and natural catastrophes at the top of the list of risks, which pain-ts a worrying picture of the deep intercon-nections between these environmental risks and the level of human health, economic growth and safety.
UniSR puts the student at the centre 
of its initiatives aimedat improving teaching, research and administrative processesand relations with the local area and encourages participationand involvement in life on campus The University therefore intends to launch 
four projects that actively involve students and staff.
The aim of these initiatives is to modify tho-
se spontaneous actions that have until now been used naturally and to transform them into virtuous actions, by involving the tea-ching staff specialising in behavioural scien-ce and defining a plan of parallel actions aimed at obtaining the commitment of the 
entire university community.

4.5 Human Resources
In order to achieve the aims of the Strategic Plan, the University puts special emphasis on the recruitment and conti-
nuing professional development of its human resources, in terms of both its administrative staff and teaching body.For the teaching staff, the University has developed an incentives policy and adopted recruitment policies that focus on internationalisation and balancing the relationship between the various teaching staff categories. Special attention will be dedicated to Associate Professors.  Recruitment will also focus on technical and administrative staff, to cover new positions supporting the pursuit of the specific operational actions envisaged by this Strategic Plan.
