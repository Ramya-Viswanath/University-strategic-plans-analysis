UC SANTA CRUZ STRATEGIC PLAN 2023
I  LEADING THE CHANGEii
CAMPUS  
OVERVIEW
UC Santa Cruz, a premier institution within the 10-campus 
University of California system, is renowned for its distinguished faculty, natural beauty, and vibrant campus community. Situated at the northern tip of the majestic Monterey Bay and near the heart of Silicon Valley, UC Santa Cruz combines the intimacy of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major public research institution. 
Since its founding in 1965, UC Santa Cruz has evolved into 
a global research university and a creative powerhouse, attracting students, faculty, and staff united by a commitment to social and environmental justice. The campus has grown from 652 students in 1965 to its current (2022–23) enrollment of 18,834 students. 
UC Santa Cruz offers 73 undergraduate majors within the 
divisions of arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences, and advanced degrees in 66 academic programs. Its residential college system (Cowell, Stevenson, Crown, Merrill, Porter, Kresge, Oakes, Rachel Carson, Nine, and John R. Lewis) also provides undergraduates with a sense of community, belonging, and academic support that is unique to UC Santa Cruz.
In 2019, Cynthia Larive began her tenure as the 11th chancellor 
of UC Santa Cruz, followed by the appointment of Lori Kletzer as campus provost and executive vice chancellor. Under Chancellor Larive and CP/EVC Kletzer’s leadership and dedication to moving the campus forward, the university embarked on a new strategic planning process, Leading the Change , formally launched in fall 2022.

  LETTER FROM THE CHANCELLOR  I3
Dear Campus Community,
This is an exciting moment for UC Santa Cruz. Over the past year, through town-hall meetings, 
open forums, focus groups, stakeholder interviews, and a campuswide survey, we have 
gathered extensive feedback from our community to help us craft a collective vision for our 
future. Leading the Change: The UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan details that vision and outlines our goals and path forward over the next decade. 
Since our founding in 1965, UC Santa Cruz has matured into a pre-eminent student-centered 
research university. We have been invited into the Association of American Universities and designated as both a Hispanic-Serving and an Asian American and Native American Pacific 
Islander-Serving Institution. We continue to embrace our founding values of social justice  and environmental sustainability, both of which are reflected in this plan. We should all take 
great pride in what our founders set out to create at UC Santa Cruz and in the university it  
has become.
Goal-setting and visioning work are not new to our campus. What we have undertaken over 
the past year builds on previous strategic planning efforts and addresses opportunities for 
improvement and transformation. Leading the Change will impact a wide cross-section of campus constituents and experiences, charting a path for us to make progress on our campus goals and establishing metrics by which success will be measured. The plan 
identifies new and emergent research, education, and service paths that will allow us to 
advance our global and regional impact; improve the experiences of our students, faculty, and staff; and strengthen our efforts to lead at the intersection of innovation and social justice.   
I am deeply grateful for the work of our Steering Committee and the five theme committees, 
and for all in our campus community who participated in this process. Together we have developed a set of important goals for our campus to implement over the next 10 years. I hope you will share in my excitement as you review Leading the Change: The UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan.    
Sincerely,Cynthia Larive  
Chancellor

 UNPARALLELED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE  I15
We aspire to be the campus of choice for students seeking an  
extraordinary education and a holistic experience that provides  
opportunities for critical thinking, creativity, exploration, and preparation to achieve their life goals. Toward this end, the committee was tasked 
with creating opportunities for faculty, staff, and students to discuss how the campus should approach undergraduate education and the student experience over the next decade.
The committee considered the following as part of its 
recommendations:
•Identifying the roles of the colleges in enhancing the student
e
xperience.
•Of
fering housing options that best support student success.
•Pr
oviding major and general education curricular options that offer
clear pathways and flexibility for exploration and also preparestudents for a successful future.
•
Cr
eating new and emerging structures and services to support
student identity, development, well-being, sense of belonging, andcommunity. These structures and services should consider thedifferent support needs of traditional first-time, transfer, non- domestic, and underrepresented students.
•
En
hancing opportunities that will strengthen and complement the
intellectual experience outside the classroom with co-curricular
experiences (e.g., service learning, internships, research opportunities,
leadership development, clubs and organizations, athletics andrecreation, and campus employment).
Goals
GOAL 1  Establish college electives
Establish a curriculum of elective courses in the colleges that builds upon the program learning outcomes of the Academic Literacy  
Curriculum, aligns with the Student Success Initiative and the Boyer 2030 Commission’s Report, and fosters the competencies for career readiness published by the National Association of Colleges and  
Employers (NACE).The vast majority (91%) of  
undergraduate students are  
interested in opportunities for 
em
ployment on campus. Most 
(83%) are interested in working with staff or faculty in their  
major department, 63% with st
aff and/or faculty at colleges, 
and nearly half at student  
resource centers.*

 UNPARALLELED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE  I17
This goal is intended to empower students to make good decisions about 
their education beyond their majors and to make college affiliation a more meaningful experience beyond the first year for all students. The proposed curriculum would provide credit-bearing learning opportunities in areas such as civic engagement and leadership, entrepreneurship,  
environmental responsibility, financial independence, health and well-being,  
legal literacy, professional communication, public speaking, and professional  
ethics (and/or similar areas). The end result would be Senate-approved certificates at each college or across colleges.
Creating certificates in the colleges would give the curriculum an  
intellectual focus and coherence that is normal for academic departments   
and programs where students pursue majors and minors. Like the col-
leges, disciplinary divisions could also develop certificates, either for themselves or in partnership with other divisions and the colleges. The new, grant-funded Humanizing Technologies certificate program in the Humanities Division illustrates what might be gained from  
divisional certificates.
Metrics
•  E stablish a planning committee that includes the Vice Provost and 
Dean of Undergraduate Education, representatives from the Council  
of Provosts, the Colleges Academic Program Policy Analyst, repre-sentatives of the Office of Campus Advising Coordination, Associate Deans from the Academic Divisions, representatives from academic departments, Career Success, and Senior Directors of College Stu-dent Life to determine what topics are optimal for certificates; what changes to existing elective curriculum and co-curricular program-ming in the colleges are necessary; and how to facilitate Senate ap-proval for the certificates and their inclusion on the official transcript.
• 
 O
rganize the launch of certificate programs in three or four  
colleges per year with the goal of establishing one certificate at each college by fall 2026.
• 
 W
ork with Institutional Research Assessment and Policy Studies  
(IRAPS) to design an assessment of the new certificates on a three- to five-year cycle.
• 
 C
reate an annual “unparalleled student experience” survey that 
includes questions regarding this goal to measure the impact on student success.At least half of students across 
colleges were interested in elective courses if their colleges offered them on topics such as 
personal finance, career readiness, 
and health and wellness.Undergraduate interest  
in elective courses for  
co-curricular experiences
> 50%
I  LEADING THE CHANGE18
•  D evelop a mechanism to measure the number of students engaged with and completing 
each certificate. This may include a survey that is administered to alumni who complete 
certificates to evaluate the impact of the certificates on student success one or two years after graduation.
GOAL 2 Develop a co-curricular record
Establish a co-curricular record to increase the visibility of, and provide structure for,  educational activities beyond credit-bearing courses. 
Many colleges and universities have taken up co-curricular records (CCR) as a mechanism of 
supporting and recognizing student engagement outside the classroom. A campuswide CCR will help students shape their engagement with UCSC and make their education their own. The CCR would be the glue that binds together scattered opportunities into coherent structures through which students can navigate their way to their goals. Adoption of a CCR would involve coordination and communication across many offices and programs, developing co-curricular pathways, and advising and encouraging students to make the most of their selected choices.
Having an agreed-upon set of learning outcomes for the entire campus, promoted by faculty 
and staff in all units, would unite us around common goals for student success. A CCR might focus on experiential learning related to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) Career Readiness Competencies for students. UCSC may wish to consider the inclusion of the co-curricular record in the permanent record, although to begin with, a non-permanent record, supported by careful guidance throughout every student’s academic journey, could transform the university’s educational environment.
Metrics
•  Establish a committee of representatives from the following areas that includes the Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education, the University Registrar, the Council of Provosts, the Colleges Academic Program Policy Analyst, representatives of the Office of Campus Advising Coordination, and the Division of Student Affairs and Success to design and implement a co-curricular record in alignment with the Student Success 

 UNPARALLELED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE  I19
Initiative and the range of competencies to inform the colleges' elective curriculum by 
academic year 2025.
•  Make an inventory of what would qualify currently as experiential education.
•  Create an annual “unparalleled student experience” survey that includes questions regarding this goal to measure the impact on student success.
•  Identify UCSC core competencies and areas for recognition.
•  Develop a method by which students will submit their activities for inclusion in the CCR.
•  Assess the level of participation of students in the co-curricular record process.
GOAL 3  Expand undergraduate experiential learning opportunities  
Ensure that every undergraduate student graduates from UCSC having participated in  
experiential  learning by creating more opportunities for students to engage in experiential 
learning through internships, individual research work with faculty, practicums, field study, 
and service learning.  
When students participate in experiential education opportunities, they gain a broader view  
of the world, an appreciation of community, and insights into their own skills, interests,  
passions, and values. They also gain a better and more enduring understanding of course 
learning objectives by applying what they have learned in the classroom in a practical  
setting. Experiential learning engages students’ emotions and enhances their knowledge and skills.
Engaging in experiential learning helps students develop critical thinking and interpersonal 
skills
 through hands-on experience and prepares them professionally for future careers. Based 
on the feedback collected by the committee, it is clear that students, staff, and faculty want  
to see  more opportunities for students to engage in experiential learning through internships, 
individual research work with faculty, practicums, field study, and service learning. It’s impor -
tant to note that experiential learning should not be a requirement, but rather a pillar  
of the undergraduate student experience that is reinforced consistently throughout each  
student’s time at UCSC.
Metrics
• 
 Establish a steering committee to develop a conceptual framework for integrating  
experiential learning as a core campus goal, not a graduation requirement. The conceptual 
framework will include a plan that includes who will be involved in integration, communication,  
promotion, and student support.

engaged in research and creative activities.
•  D eepen existing partnerships with the Silicon Valley Campus to  
ensure that students have increased access to internship opportunities

that every student in the class of 2028 would graduate having had an experiential learning experience.
•

• 
 O
riginate a process for drawing data from co-curricular records, to

GOAL 4 Create living rooms across campus to promote  
interaction and community  
Create true living rooms throughout the campus, which would include 
the renovation of the Bay Tree Building; the development of commuter  
lounges at the main campus, Coastal Science Campus, and Silicon Valley Campus; and the creation of more eateries, lounges/program spaces, and study spaces for students. 
We want students to feel a sense of belonging while on the UCSC 
campuses. This goal would provide gathering spaces in the form of true living rooms and commuter lounges and ensure that these spaces, including the sidewalks, bike lanes, and pathways that lead to them, are physically accessible to all. The commuter lounges could serve as programming spaces to bring students together socially and also be  
locations where staff from departments like Counseling & Psychological  
Services (CAPS), Slug Support, Academic Advising, Career Success, or Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS) would hold office hours to bring critical services to students where they are.
 UNPARALLELED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE  I21

I  LEADING THE CHANGE22
The concept of inclusive, intentionally planned, and dynamic spaces will support a sense of 
belonging on campus. An initiative is already underway to renovate the Bay Tree Building, and a goal of this project is to create a living room for the campus, with open areas for gathering,  increased flow between the three floors of the building, and flexible space that can be used for student programming. Students have expressed that there are no central places where they can work comfortably, get a good bite to eat, and connect. For example, nearly two-thirds — 62% — of the students surveyed responded that a commuter lounge would make a positive difference for students; 50% of staff respondents said the same.
Metrics
•  Develop a campuswide initiative involving Capital Planning & Space Management, the  
Colleges, the Division of Student Affairs and Success (DSAS), the Coastal Science Campus, the Silicon Valley Campus, and many others to implement this goal. This work would be conducted in collaboration with the University Space Committee.
•  C omplete a space audit to identify potential spaces and develop programming plans to design  
spaces and operational plans to inform how spaces would be managed and sustained.
•  Ensure that students are informed at every step of the implementation process. 
•  Allocate budget for appropriate student space projects.
•  Provide a central location on the DSAS website that lists these spaces for new students and helps with engagement by student support offices.
•  Create an annual “unparalleled student experience” survey that includes questions regarding this goal to measure the impact on student success.

Advancing graduate student success is our guiding principle for envisioning graduate education   
in the future. The strategic shift from graduate growth to a focus on graduate student success  
will require prioritizing graduate programs and students and directing resources to enable graduate students to thrive academically, professionally, and personally. We need to involve 
the whole campus community in a data-driven graduate student success approach of 
student engagement and positive outcomes, such as time to degree, graduation rates, and placement, to achieve our goal of inclusive excellence in graduate education. 
Need-based competitive summer support and research support are crucial for graduate student  
success. Financial support is intertwined with a broader enhancement of mentorship and

has been identified as the  
number one barrier ; 9 2% of  
doctoral students want an

supplement.  Barriers to timely  
program completioncareer and professional development (e.g., training in writing proposals  
for extramural research support, divisional curricular interventions, 
and financial support for scholarly travel for conferences, meetings, 
and professional development activities) at the department, academic  division, and graduate division level. In collaboration with the programs, the Academic Senate, and the Career Center, we plan to develop a continuing and sequenced professional and career 
development. The 
Graduate Division will function as a hub for incentivizing and admin -
istering Individualized Development Plans (IDP) as a framework for t
rainee-initiated reflection, goal setting during their academic careers, 
and productive mentoring conversations in career planning, leading  
to a reassessment of program learning outcomes (PLO) related to 
professionalization. Following other successful examples in the UC and other R1 graduate divisions, we need to prioritize fundraising for graduate student fellowships, particularly for students who are underrepresented in higher education or undocumented. In addition, developing a process to engage UCSC graduate student alumni will enhance career awareness and development for our current graduate 
students. Establishing regional chapters and engagement programming  
for international graduate students would also help build a powerful mentorship network with graduate alumni.
Beyond funding, we must provide comprehensive 360-degree student- 
centric services to students throughout their academic journey, ensuring  
that they receive the guidance and resources they need to succeed, 
ranging from pre-enrollment (recruitment and admission), enrollment  
through graduation, and post-graduation success. Enhanced central 
and departmental services can help students navigate the admis -
sions process,  providing assistance with applications, financial aid, 
and recruitment. Mentoring programs can provide one-on-one guidance  
from experienced faculty or staff members, helping students to develop academic and professional skills and offering guidance on career paths 
and opportunities. Professional development services such as workshops,  
seminars, professional travel, and other resources should be provided to help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to excel in their chosen fields. Together, these services provide a student-centric and holistic approach to supporting graduate students, helping them to achieve their academic and career goals. 
Our goal is to provide our doctoral students with full 5-year support 
packages, including increased fellowship and need-based summer  
support, as well as incentives to increase external GSR support, which are essential components of funding graduate student success. 92%

GOAL 2  Foster inclusive excellence in graduate education 
Build and support a welcoming, respectful, strong, diverse, and resilient graduate community.  
The Graduate Division is committed to recruiting, enrolling, supporting, mentoring, and 
graduating  a diverse student body reflecting the cultural and ethnic diversity of our state and 
nation. Achieving this goal requires the Graduate Division and campus to identify and address 
structural and cultural barriers that prevent graduate students from earning an advanced degree.  
We need to foster a culture of staff development and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training 
across Graduate Studies. We must ensure that staff have the necessary management skills 
and cultural competency and provide training in holistic admissions. The creation of DEI  
Recruitment Advisory Committees will ensure that diverse perspectives and voices are included 
in the assessment of applicants and bring diversity and inclusive excellence into recruitment 
practices. The Graduate Division should support the development of its staff and foster an envi -
ronment where every person feels responsible for advancing diversity and inclusion excellence.
Graduate programs must improve representation among faculty, researchers, staff, and  graduate students. Improved representation requires an increased emphasis on recruiting,  training, incentives, and recognition of extra (often unpaid) work done by many campus colleagues in pursuit of DEI objectives. DEI in graduate programs supports the DEI initiative in undergraduate programs, as there are well-known, positive benefits from increased represen -
tation at every level, and helping our undergraduate students to thrive, get research experience,  
and see examples of successful graduate students can be life-changing and provide  
impor tant practical opportunities.
Lastly, we need to establish programming to support DEI efforts at the program level and  establish a DEI Innovation Fund to enhance DEI programming and support for faculty/ programs supporting and mentoring underrepresented students.

GOAL 3  Strengthen existing and develop new graduate programs in strategic areas
Foster innovation in graduate education, especially in supporting existing and creating new 
programs, delivering courses and programs in a wide range of modalities, and extending educational opportunities to non-traditional learners.  
There are two distinct and important strategic goals: re-envisioning and strengthening current 
graduate programs, and creating new graduate programs. The need for re-envisioning an existing  
graduate program could depend on changes in fields, student interest, external funding, and 
other factors outside our control. We have an existing review process for graduate programs, 
and this should be leveraged to help identify how our current programs could be more  
successful. Options for changing and strengthening existing programs include redefining scope and goals or combining with other programs (e.g., joint degrees with CSUs), in some cases making programs broader or more interdisciplinary. In addition, we should consider whether existing programs need to add or remove degrees or modify degree modalities. 
The campus could also consider developing new graduate programs, though these should 
be carefully researched and targeted to ensure sufficient student demand and resources to sustain the program. As feasible, external fundraising to support the launch of new graduate programs could support their establishment and trajectory.  

  ENVISIONING GRADUATE EDUCATION FOR THE FUTURE  I33
Whether for existing programs or new programs, degree modalities 
must be selected in the context of what makes the most sense in terms of the curriculum and programmatic goals.
As the primary obstacle to graduate education at UCSC remains the 
lack of affordable housing, any vision for creating new degree-granting 
programs must take this into account. The second most present  
challenge that graduate education faces, not just at UCSC but  
everywhere, is that the traditional pathways from graduate school into 
the academy have diminished in many fields. Therefore, appetite is 
growing for graduate education that re-envisions the kind of training that students receive to equip them realistically to work in professions that are not academia. This is especially true in STEM, where alternative
 and 
often more attractive and lucrative career paths (vs. academia) have 
emerged over the past several decades, leading to the relative diminishing  
of academic paths being taken.
However, from the perspective of a research university, we must not 
identify the goals of expanding our graduate offerings exclusively to the 
market’s demands. Instead, we should explore the emerging space of credentialing for graduate students (e.g., designated emphasis programs;
 
certificate programs; micro-credentials; digital badges). The campus should also explore the development of additional master’s programs (also in conjunction with pathway programs), specifically professional 
master’s degrees, that could be completed online wholly or in part, and the evolution of Ph.D. programs toward whole or partial  
completion online. 
This plan will impact individual disciplines in different ways — not all 
disciplines can offer graduate programs that can be completed wholly or partially online. However, the generation of more online professional master’s programs will have the dual effect of reducing the density of 
graduate students in Santa Cruz while simultaneously generating income  
that could be used to offset housing costs for resident students,  
particularly those studying in disciplines that cannot be completed 
wholly or partially online. We propose exploring the viability of offering 
more hybrid or fully online professional master’s programs and more half-time, low-residency programs. Finally, we wish to call attention to the inordinate amount of time required to process new program appli -
cations. In the interest of expanding UCSC’s graduate offerings, the new program development process should be streamlined and resources dedicated to assisting program designers, including course buyouts and guidance from the Teaching and Learning Center, as an example.The majority of doctoral 
students  indicated a lack of 
financial support, with funding 
support during the summer as the top priority (82%), followed by fellowship support for their first-year experience (64%).

GOAL 4 Elevate and enhance support for graduate students
Elevate and enhance support for students on- and off-campus, including affordable housing, transportation, and basic needs support.
Several initiatives have been undertaken in recent years geared toward alleviating financial and 
housing-related burdens faced by graduate students, including the annual housing supplement for MFA and Ph.D. students, relocation supplements for incoming Ph.D. and MFA students, and the temporary Housing Assistance Fund (award matching program with Slug Support) through the Graduate Division. UCSC students also have access to free legal consultation through a San Jose–based law firm for support with off-campus tenancy-related legal concerns. To address the current gap between graduate student financial resources and costs of basic needs 
and assist in data-driven planning, the Graduate Cost of Attendance and Living (GCOAL) 
Calculator should be updated annually and used to provide information for decision-making. 
Similarly, indexing the annual housing supplement for MFA and Ph.D. students to the GCOAL, and 
indexing  the rental rates of campus Graduate Student and Family Housing to 30% of graduate 
student household income, could help with the lack of affordable housing for graduate students.
These initiatives will support progress toward mitigating the housing-related financial burden our graduate students face and ensur
ing that every graduate student can meet their 
basic needs. 
I  LEADING THE CHANGE36
In order to achieve the transportation needs of graduate students, it is 
essential to incorporate a range of transportation options and leverage data to ensure that the transportation system is meeting the unique needs of graduate students. This could involve collaboration between the university, local government, and private partners to identify and implement sustainable transportation solutions that are affordable, accessible, and reliable.
By conducting a thorough analysis of the current transportation system 
and assessing the transportation needs of graduate students, we  
can develop targeted interventions that address specific gaps and  
challenges. Furthermore, by incorporating feedback mechanisms and 
regularly assessing the effectiveness of transportation initiatives, we can   
make data-driven decisions to continuously improve the transportation  
system for graduate students. By adopting a strategic approach, we can create a transportation system that not only meets the needs of graduate students but also supports their academic success and contributes to the overall sustainability of the community.
The University of California defines basic needs as the minimum  
resources necessary 
to holistically support all students in their daily 
lives. It is an ecosystem  that supports financial stability by ensuring 
equitable access to nutritious and sufficient food; safe, secure, and 
adequate housing (to sleep, study, cook, and shower); healthcare to 
promote sustained mental and physical well-being;  affordable trans -
portation; resources for personal hygiene care; and emergency needs 
for students with dependents.
Slug Support provides emergency/hardship funding for graduate  
students; support with immediate basic needs gaps, including temporary   
emergency housing; and access to grocery gift cards and meal swipes. A large portion of the emergency funding has been allocated to
ward gaps for housing costs. Funding for Slug Support emergency 
awards is non-permanent and is supplemented by donations, which 
can impact and limit the capacity of the program to provide support 
for students. Historically, graduate students have faced difficulty  
accessing CalFresh due to a lack of nuanced understanding of graduate  
student income by the County. Additionally, the Redwood Free Market 
(food pantry) has increased distribution days to five days a week, with  
a dedicated distribution date for graduate students.
Through the implementation of the recommendations listed below, 
the university can continue to build on our efforts to help reduce the Where support is

Goals
GOAL 1  Establish and develop areas of excellence
Build on our shared values to identify areas of research strength that should be preserved 
and leveraged, as well as emerging areas for faculty and staff investments. 
The campus should identify, cultivate, and support established and emerging areas of research  
excellence — areas that would lead faculty, students, and staff to choose UCSC for their careers  
and education and attract funders to invest in our vision. Those areas of excellence should emerge from a deliberative process involving faculty, students, staff, and key outside constitu -
encies. Concrete and credible examples should back the areas identified. Beyond surfacing those strengths, the process should be designed to build broad recognition and support.
Our campus vision is to lead at the intersection of social justice and innovation, including 
a growing commitment to community-engaged scholarship, embracing our status as a minority-serving institution, and maintaining our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and justice and our ability to generate scholarship that shapes and creates new fields of study. That vision, and the research it generated, led to our election in 2019 to the Association of American Universities (AAU, composed of the leading research universities in North America) and the systemwide investment in the campus to promote climate resilience. While the charge had bullets requesting that the subcommittee identify areas of strength and emerging themes, we lacked comparative institutional data or the time, staffing, or campus engagement needed to do a deep, inwardly focused assessment. With our shared vision in mind, the campus should try different approaches to evaluate our existing research programs. These approaches would include short-term work to quickly identify broad areas to invest in 
research growth and longer-term revisions to the external review process that would look at all 
I  LEADING THE CHANGE42
our research programs, ensuring that we retain the excellence that led 
to our AAU membership and are also able to support additional areas of excellence. The approaches should also build on ideas in the 2018 Strategic Academic Plan and aspirations that have arisen since that time to formulate a strategy for sustaining and growing our research profile in the next decade.

Advance our mission, values, and strengths by removing barriers 
and investing in institutional structures, facilities, staff, and faculty in ways that incentivize extramural funding and bolster interdisciplinary, community-engaged, and center-scale work.

I  LEADING THE CHANGE44
remain. On the pre-award side, even with more grant writers in the Office of Research and other 
units, stakeholders still felt under-supported, especially for large, complex proposals. They wanted more streamlined ways to submit proposals and pull together matching support and greater assistance with the mechanics of proposal assembly. Post-award there 
were many 
comments about difficulties with procurement, reimbursement, and Institutional Review 
Board reviews. The struggles impacting research accounting and reporting, especially following  
the transition to UC Path, were highlighted by STEM faculty. And administrative requirements 
for research continue to grow in response to federal and state policy. A common refrain from our stakeholder feedback was the erosion of time for research due to the increased demands on faculty/researcher time (more on this below). And stakeholders noted that all these issues were exacerbated when funding and supporting interdisciplinary work.
Our subcommittee and stakeholders identified five ways to address this constellation of issues. Overall, stakeholders felt the campus offers too little staff support for seeking and administering research awards, pushing this work onto administrative staff paid-off grants (if 
available and allowable) or more often, to faculty, researchers, postdocs, and graduate students.  
These management issues become more complex when the work crosses department or  
divisional lines. We need additional staff trained in grant submission and management and staff to assist with the purchasing, hiring, and other expenditures of research funds. In addition,
 
staff retention was viewed as a large issue. Staff move positions within the campus to get an appreciable increase in salary. And salaries are often higher at other UCs, so staff move away after the campus has invested in their training. High internal turnover and staff loss reduce the effectiveness of our already slim research staff. Staff need clear paths to advance in their positions so they are retained longer, making their motivation to move more related to career aspirations and less to financial considerations.
Streamlining processes and internal policies to increase overall efficiency while effectively 
mitigating critical risks to researchers and the university is also essential. While substantial 
progress has been made in some of the areas identified in the relatively recent National Council  
of University Research Administrators (NCURA) report, reviewing it for additional points of potential efficiency and staffing recommendations would also be useful. We understand that a review of research accounting and reporting is planned for 2023–24, and it would be ideal if it resulted in shared research budgeting systems and practices that more easily support work that crosses disciplines. Finally, stakeholders believed that our processes needed to increase equitable access to seed funds at multiple levels and across the divisions to help initiate impactful projects and supply bridge funds to sustain graduate student researchers (GSRs) and project scientists during limited gaps in external funding.
Given the minimal support for research at the department level, stakeholders viewed  
institutes  and centers as crucial to meeting our research aspirations, especially in relation to 
interdisciplinary work. Very few of our institutes and well-established centers fit neatly under 
the domain of a single department. Institutes and centers differ widely in their structure and resources. But in aggregate, they offer a suite of essential services to the faculty, students, 
  DISTINCTION IN RESEARCH, SCHOLARLY AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES  I45
and researchers working in their intellectual domains — research development, support with 
project management at various scales, specialized facilities, assistance with events, and more. Ideally, institutes and centers would function as more than the sum of their affiliated faculty 
and researchers. While the system for establishing and reviewing institutes has been formalized,  
centers have no analogous formal structure. Stakeholders and the subcommittee believe we need guidelines for the establishment, review, and sunsetting of centers and that for both institutes and centers, we need clearer models for allocating resources, including director compensation, staff support, space, programming, initiatives, and development.
Many stakeholders focused on approaches to spur inter- and transdisciplinary research and 
work that is community engaged, both via external funding and through more robust internal systems of support. Many of the structural changes suggested above could have dispropor -
tionate impacts on this type of research, for example, through transparent systems to support 
institutes and centers or more similar research accounting and management practices across divisions. There were more focused suggestions, including hiring staff to be placed with Campus + Community dedicated to facilitating community engagement consistent with best practices and UCSC values, along with seed funding to develop and promote community-engaged research. 
Finally, stakeholders noted that the time spent in the classroom at UCSC is higher than at 
other UCs or comparable R1 universities. With default 5-unit courses (equivalent in contact time to a semester) but annual teaching loads similar to other quarter schools with default 3- or 4-unit classes (where two-semester equivalents of contact are spread over three quarters), 
over-teaching at UCSC can have a major impact on faculty time. For example, when comparing  
faculty with an annual three-course load, UCSC faculty will have 20 hours more podium time 

I  LEADING THE CHANGE46
per year than faculty at UCLA, equivalent to almost an entire additional UCLA course. If UCSC 
faculty spend much more time in the classroom than faculty at other R1 universities, they have less time for the other work they need to do. Undoubtedly, this structural over-teaching contributes to the campus having one of the highest student-to-faculty ratios in the system. It 
likely contributes to our struggles with student success. And to the charge of our subcommittee,  
it could negatively impact research productivity and faculty's ability to successfully land  
extramural funding. The campus should strongly consider adjusting its teaching load to 
match other R1 universities in the UC system and beyond.

GOAL 3  Support the physical research infrastructure 
Address the facilities, power, and computational constraints that limit the potential growth 
of research and creative work, and create and maintain spaces for the exchange of ideas to promote research collaboration.
Concerns about space were raised universally by all stakeholders, both for working and living. 
It is impossible to discuss the future of the campus and not hear about the housing crisis and how it impacts all members of the campus community. Stakeholders repeatedly cited the need for more functional space to conduct excellent research and creative work. They ques -
tioned how we could expand our faculty ranks when office and lab space are already close to capacity. Deferred maintenance was also cited as having an adverse effect on research and the ability to attract and retain excellent faculty. The campus needs to evaluate the current use and condition of existing research and creative spaces, as well as future needs, inclusive of storage. That would include reviewing the accessibility and additional uses of developed land, Westside Research Park, Monterey Bay Education, Science and Technology Center (MBEST), and the Silicon Valley Campus, and options to further leverage partner facilities (e.g., NOAA).

I  LEADING THE CHANGE48
Reliable power and increased computational resources are also critical to productivity, the 
continued strength of high-profile programs, the growth of emerging areas of excellence, and risk mitigation. Frequent power interruptions were cited repeatedly as highly disruptive to 
research and costly in terms of lost time, lost samples, and damaged equipment. Both  
students and faculty noted that broadband coverage could be more consistent across campus,  
including in areas where research and training activities might be expected to take place, also 
curbing productivity. Information Technology Services should identify gaps in network coverage  
and strength and bring all spaces where research and training activities might reasonably  
occur up to National Telecommunications and Information Administration broadband 
standards or better. The campus needs increased access to supercomputing capabilities and secure data storage. Finally, higher-speed network connections on- and off-campus are required, especially with greater reliance on colocation and the cloud. Before implementing 
these changes, we should consider leveraging the Climate Change, Sustainability and  
Resilience Committee (CCSRC) recommendations to prioritize and plan.
Informal and interdisciplinary interactions are a hallmark of the campus’s founding as a  
different kind of UC. Stakeholder meetings revealed that faculty want to interact with one  
another, but that isolation — especially since the pandemic — and the campus’s space chal -
lenges have conspired to limit the informal interactions that build research excellence. A 
solution would be to create spaces (ideally with food) that foster transdisciplinary research 
exchange, including casual spaces that encourage serendipitous meetups where faculty and students can talk over food. This would also draw faculty to campus areas outside of their offices and labs. These spaces are needed year-round. In addition, there was a desire for more substantial and dedicated conference facilities to hold more events that would emerge from informal collaborations and to hire staff to support events beyond existing research centers.

GOAL 4 Attract and retain faculty, staff, and students  
Increase the successful recruitment and retention of a diverse community of excellent faculty, staff, and students. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion as drivers of research excellence were repeatedly highlighted 
in stakeholder meetings. Participants noted that while the diversity of the student body and upper administration has grown, representation among Senate faculty needs to catch up. The planned Faculty 100 hires over the next 10 years provide an opportunity to remedy the gap. The campus should support and incentivize the hiring of UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellows. Other recommendations made by the Inclusive and Thriving Campus Community Committee 
I  LEADING THE CHANGE50
(ITCC) should aid in attracting and retaining diverse talent. Stakeholder feedback also  
indicated that housing affordability remains a major barrier in attracting and retaining the 
excellent faculty, staff, postdocs, and students on which the research enterprise depends. Financing and planning to enable the renovation and building of additional housing facilities on 
UCSC properties will remain critical, as will working with local leaders to advocate for programs  
and policies that support off-campus access.

GOAL 5 Rethink what counts in merit review and how research is evaluated  
UCSC takes a maximal approach to merit review. We should envision a simpler practice. Based on stakeholder feedback, we recommend that the merit review process be rethought, revised, and streamlined. At the same time, we must ensure that faculty are rewarded for new forms of research, risk-taking, and their contributions to DEI.
Aligned with the campus goal of increased efficiency, we should find ways to reduce the time 
spent on merit reviews. Faculty members, departments, Academic Human Resources, deans, the Committee on Academic Personnel, the Academic Personnel Office, and the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor’s office spend considerable time crafting and reviewing merit review files. A more efficient and straightforward practice would reduce workload while we maintain transparency and ensure equitable salary increases. Merit reviews should also incentivize risk-taking in research and acknowledge how taxing it is to try to be outstanding in all three areas at every review (as incentivized by our current Special Salary Practice [SSP]). We want researchers who will take their fields in new directions. The current merit review process, however, disincentivizes risk-taking. We should change that to reward strong attempts. 
  DISTINCTION IN RESEARCH, SCHOLARLY AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES  I51

I  LEADING THE CHANGE52

  DISTINCTION IN RESEARCH, SCHOLARLY AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES  I53
In addition, our campus should build on efforts already underway to acknowledge a broad 
definition of research, including community-engaged, public, and digital scholarship. With the September 2022 memo from the Committee on Academic Personnel and the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, our campus is moving to understand research more capaciously than in the past. However, survey data revealed that there remains the belief that public-facing work is undervalued as research. In addition, a broader consideration of research should take into account scholarly activity that happens at the interaction of research, teaching, and service. 
Finally, we need to credit and clarify expectations around contributions to diversity, equity, and 
inclusion (DEI). Stakeholder feedback revealed that faculty and reviewers need clarification about standards and recognition for DEI contributions to research and other categories. For faculty engaging in invisible labor, which is often DEI-related, we need a mechanism to recognize, alleviate, and compensate for that labor, which usually has a direct impact on research productivity. Some of this work contributes to faculty backing up at Associate Professor Step 4. Consider bringing back Associate Professor Step 5 and/or hiring at lower entry steps with higher off-scale components, as other UCs do. Transitioning to appointing 
new faculty at lower steps (with higher off-scales) is another option to slow the time toward 
reaching barrier steps.
Metrics
•  A sk for guidance from the Senate, including a review of the current merit review process, an 
analysis of the impact of the Special Salary Practice, and an analysis of faculty salary equity programs. Compare our process with other UCs, across UCSC departments and what we’ve done in the past (including the “short-form merits”).

We seek to embed principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion  
because we aspire to extraordinary outcomes in research, scholarship  
and creative activities, teaching, and other related pursuits. Excellence  
can only be achieved when the members of our campus community 
feel respected, valued, and welcomed. The committee was tasked with creating opportunities for faculty, staff, and students to discuss how the campus should approach improving the diversity, equity, and inclusivity of our campus as reflected in its overall climate over the next decade.

campus levels on the importance of contributions to diversity, eq-uity and inclusion, and inclusive teaching, especially concerning the transparency of their value in the merit review process.
Goals
GOAL 1  Improve faculty and staff hiring and review
Improve the hiring practices for faculty, staff, and students to align with research-based best practices for inclusion and fairness. Improve review/appraisal practices for faculty and staff to be more equitable, transparent, and consistent across time and settings, and, in particular, to improve how contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion are documented, assessed, and recognized.
Transparency, expert mentoring, and staff support before, during, and 
after the review/appraisal process are important for building a long-lasting culture that values inclusion, fairness, diversity, and equity.
 
T
here are many research-based approaches for improving 
inclusive faculty hiring. A top priority is improved training for search committees and department faculty in discussing, trying out, and implementing such methods. The current processes for faculty hiring already center on contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Faculty Equity Advocates are working on the next generation of fair hiring training materials and should be supported in that effort.
For faculty reviews, some areas for exploration are:
•
 H
ow teaching inclusivity is documented, assessed, and recognized 
(perhaps using department-developed rubrics or revising rubrics 
available from the Teaching and Learning Center)
• D
ocumenting, including, and assessing DEI contributions in teaching, 
service, or research > 50%
More than half of 
undergraduate students, graduate students, staff, and faculty who responded to our survey believe the campus should recruit and retain more faculty of color .
I  LEADING THE CHANGE58
• E xpanding definitions of research productivity to include community-engaged, digital, or 
public scholarship, and practitioner-oriented publications 
• A
ddressing whether contributions to diversity are a separate fourth category or are integrated 
into the assessment of each of three current categories (i.e., research, teaching, service) 
•
 A
ddressing how the different categories (whether 3 or 4) are weighted
The campus Fair Hiring Guide provides information and resources for staff hiring, and there 
is an online training module and a systemwide Implicit Bias Series. However, these are not required. Search committees would benefit from additional support and a requirement to complete the training module and bias series every two years. The campus should explore creating a Staff Equity Advocate program akin to Faculty Equity Advocates. 
For staff reviews, campus guidance needs to be developed on the inclusion of contributions 
to DEI. Training should also be developed to help supervisors include and effectively evaluate these contributions.
In alignment with research-based best practices, another recommendation that benefits 
faculty and staff hiring is dedicating central funds for campuswide prepaid advertising to create a pool of applicants that reflects the diversity of applicants’ fields. All jobs would automatically be posted to predefined venues with the purpose of enhancing strategies to increase diversity equitably across campus.
Because the student hiring process is extremely decentralized, it is difficult to influence 
that process. Training materials and guidelines might be better distributed, and additional resources may be required for outreach and distribution. In particular, faculty may need more support and training to learn best practices for hiring students. Successful hires can depend on helping the students develop a sense of belonging. The Career Success Supervision Toolkit provides resources for mentoring student employees. It may be helpful to explore the creation of a staff position to work with faculty and staff during the hiring process to improve inclusive and fair practices for student recruitment and hiring.
Metrics
•  E nsure that hiring and review/appraisal guidelines are aligned with the campus vision 
and that DEI contributions are included in hiring and reviews/appraisals. Consider adding “contributions to DEI” as a standalone fourth category in faculty review.
• 
 U
se and build on research-based best practices, including relying on our staff, faculty, and 
other experts. Expand definitions of “research” and “scholarship,” and abide by the credo, “Nothing about us without us.” For example, moving from a culture that “accommodates” disability and chronic illness to one that incorporates access into every aspect of the university experience.

  INCLUSIVE AND THRIVING CAMPUS COMMUNITY  I59
•  S upply written materials and make them easily accessible and searchable. Provide multiple 
opportunities and settings for discussion (e.g., scenarios, small groups, long-term study 
groups, reflection, and self-improvement) and develop sufficient resources (e.g., funding, time, staffing, organizational support, professional facilitation, and consultation with the Academic Personnel Office and Staff Human Resources).
• 
 C

Program, and dedicate central funds for advertising positions to a diverse applicant pool.

GOAL 2 Inventory, integrate, and embed DEI into the campus culture
Establish clear goals and expected outcomes and improve transparency, clarity, and alignment of DEI expectations and opportunities. Bolster ODEI and divisional DEI roles and offices, growing their capacity to collaborate with campus partners and serve as a nexus for campuswide and divisional DEI efforts, respectively. Propose mechanisms to conduct more extensive campus conversations and action plans to ensure an inclusive campus community, recommend clearer pathways to support those experiencing non-inclusive behaviors, and hold each community member accountable to our values in the face of ruptures.
UCSC should develop a tool for gathering and assessing information about DEI efforts in academic and non-academic units with the assistance of the Academic Senate, Staff Advisory 

I  LEADING THE CHANGE60
Board (SAB), Graduate Student Association (GSA), and Student Union Assembly (SUA). Given 
the sheer volume of work that has been conducted but only sometimes shared widely, we 
need to develop more concerted coordination among ODEI, Institutional Research, Assessment,  
and Policy Studies (IRAPS), and other entities on campus seeking to do data gathering, analysis, and communication in the DEI space. Additionally, we support expanding DEI data gathering and analytical capacity to expand collaboration across campus in the DEI research and planning space.
The Chancellor’s empowerment of the ODEI with the hiring of our first Vice Chancellor of DEI, 
the new Associate Vice Chancellor of Equity and Equal Protection, and the new University 
Ombuds, elevates the importance of these needed units and prioritizes belonging on campus. Additionally, the Academic Personnel Office, Hate/Bias Response Team, and Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) of the Office of Risk and Safety Services address real and perceived institutional, programmatic, and other equity-related gaps and cultures of exclusion. These offices should be fully staffed to avoid delays in responding to compliance needs and addressing climate concerns. 
Additionally, we should consider connecting our Principles of Community to campus policies to go beyond compliance when developing strategies to improve our climate.
As members of our community, we must be able to trust in our protocols, processes, and 
systems for addressing any issues of discrimination, harassment, assault, or campus climate. Trust in our systems is enabled in our community’s learning that problems are being addressed, solutions enacted, and trends identified to improve our processes and protocols. Behaviors that do not rise to policy violations should nonetheless be tracked in how they contribute to a hostile working environment, including where there are frequent occurrences by the same person. The need for Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) to support students who engage with the reporting process is critical to recognize so that they may be well-resourced in addressing DEI issues on campus. To ensure confidentiality while modeling transparency, there should be proactive communication around policies and procedures to assure communities affected by complaints and grievances that disciplinary and other investigatory actions have taken place.

•  E xpand mental health resources for faculty, staff, and students. Building on the Behavioral 
Intervention Team (BIT), Campus Safety Community Advisory Board (CAB), and Counseling 
and Psychological Services (CAPS), create an ecosystem of care and community response that addresses the individual and collective impacts of ongoing inequities.
GOAL 3  Develop DEI learning pathways and integrate accountability frameworks 
Develop a comprehensive metric to track and assess DEI programs. Create more cohort-based learning pathways with reasonable time to completion and appropriate scheduling. Scaffold learning opportunities to entail growth and avoid U.S.-centric perspectives. Ensure that sufficient resources and incentives exist for developing, assessing, and participating in learning opportunities.
UCSC’s current DEI professional development resources are growing but remain scattered and 
primarily optional in nature outside of the hiring context. The university should consider using a comprehensive metric to better track and assess DEI progress over time. Identifying appropriate metrics for each campus population should be informed by their respective policies and DEI best practices and documented with clear and transparent goals.
At present, students are the only group with mandatory DEI training. We Are Slugs! is an 
online asynchronous training for incoming students. Additional learning opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students are available from F.R.E.D. (Facilitators for Race and Ethnic Diversity), currently funded and sustained through the African American Resource and Cultural 
Center by annual funding requests to the Student Fee Advisory Committee Call for Funding Proposals; and from LinkedIn Learning.
There is no required DEI training for all staff, though hiring search committee members are required to complete the online Managing Implicit Bias series required of faculty members serving on search committees.
Feedback indicates that one-off workshops such as these are not viable solutions. For several 
years, ODEI has provided the Diversity & Inclusion Certificate Program (DICP) to faculty and 
staff members. While interest in the program remains high, the time to completion is up to two 
years, and courses are scheduled at inconvenient times for faculty. Additionally, participants 
must complete the same introductory courses regardless of prior academic or professional experience. (The program is on pause in 2023–24 as ODEI assesses and reimagines its  
DEI professional development programming.)
Models of equity learning should be offered with intentionality for different cohorts. For instance, 
we support incorporating DEI learning into the Core Course for incoming first-year students and onboarding training for graduate student employees, similar to what the Teaching and Learning Center offers for new incoming faculty for foundational learning. Faculty and scholars who were 
  INCLUSIVE AND THRIVING CAMPUS COMMUNITY  I63
socialized or educated outside the United States may need additional DEI offerings that take 
international context into consideration. Many members of domestic marginalized groups respond 
differently to introductory-level DEI programs than those with only a base level of 
understanding. Nor can we assume intersectional understanding exists across marginalized 
populations. DEI offerings can emphasize solidarities while recognizing potential intergroup chal
lenges, such as colorism, casteism, bias on socioeconomic lines or based on academic 
pedigree, and privileges of U.S. citizenship or legal residence within mixed-status communities.
Metrics
•  C ommit to personal and professional growth through DEI learning opportunities, which 
should be an expectation of every community member, including faculty, staff, students, leadership, and volunteers. Every campus member should participate in an equity assessment to evaluate their level of knowledge.
• 
 C

 O
ffer sustained funding for internal and external programs such as F.R.E.D., Academic 
Impressions, LinkedIn Learning, and other programs. Such opportunities should be more equitably available to all employees.
I  LEADING THE CHANGE64
•  DICP (or subsequent programs in ODEI) should offer introductory, intermediate, and advanced  
professional development for faculty, staff, and students, and instructors/facilitators should 
receive compensation for their time.
• 
 Create DEI-related learning experiences in cohort form to provide a shared community 
expectation about how goals will apply going forward. Learning opportunities should be 
offered in a scaffolded manner for all learner levels and continuously for ongoing development.
GOAL 4 Address barriers to retention for marginalized faculty, staff, and students  
Proactively support retention efforts for faculty and staff from marginalized identities. Recognize the burden of identity taxation and build in expectations for DEI priorities for  all employees.
UC Santa Cruz stated that a key goal in its faculty recruitment efforts is to increase the percentages of faculty of color, women, LGBTQ+, and individuals with disabilities by 2030. Similarly, we support recruiting and retaining a diverse staff. Key to these efforts are intentional steps to reduce identity taxation, build community, and send a clear signal  when climates need to change to become more inclusive.
Our findings suggest that centering joy is essential to the success of marginalized groups, 
both through structured activities and events and by coming together in community. This does not happen in a vacuum. Holding events to celebrate our campus’s diversity is a priority supported by our survey data, but so is the importance of providing affinity group spaces for populations currently without access to them. Yet creating community is only one step in helping to build retention. Ensuring healthy climates for all employees is central to a longer-term strategy.
  INCLUSIVE AND THRIVING CAMPUS COMMUNITY  I65
Microaggressions or other instances of bias against BIPOC, LGBTQ+, or otherwise  
marginalized employees by students and colleagues alike must be addressed swiftly to reduce future disengagement or risks of early departures. Employees needing religious and/or disability accommodations should be more holistically taken into account when building welcoming climates. In all ways, DEI metrics must move beyond the performative to ensure that deeper work is rewarded in promotions and advancements, particularly given potential issues around salary equity. In some cases, previous hurtful incidents that disproportionately impacted marginalized populations merit institutional reckoning. And administrative and curricular policies, procedures, and priorities must be reassessed through the lens of equity and inclusion whenever possible.
Metrics
•  B uild community among and between marginalized groups to help shore up employee  
morale and center joy.
•  I
ntentionally recognize the identity tax imposed on many marginalized faculty and staff  
and work to ensure a more equitable model of DEI work by all employees.
•  E
xamine salary equity issues disproportionately affecting marginalized faculty.
•  C
onsider how DEI is prioritized in faculty recruitment, retention, and promotion.
•  E
valuate DEI training across all ranks and levels, including an emphasis on our Community 
Principles and shared mission.
GOAL 5 Support opportunities to connect university members to one another and 
the wider community  
Provide opportunities for students to engage in debate and discussion outside of the classroom. Build more pipelines to community audiences and collaborators. More forcefully reckon with our local and regional histories of genocide, racism, xenophobia, and exclusion and support efforts to tell the stories of our marginalized community members.
UCSC should strive to strengthen connections among and between student groups, staff support networks, and faculty networks as a priority for community building on campus. For instance, it might revive student debate as a method to provide undergraduates with a learning opportunity to respectfully engage in public domains, including local governments, state bodies, and elsewhere. Divisions and departments can continue to organize student fora in leadership councils, town halls, or elsewhere. Moreover, the collegiate system on which the campus was founded offered great extracurricular opportunities in the early years of our campus. It might be time to reimagine how to foster the capacity for public debate.
I  LEADING THE CHANGE66

  INCLUSIVE AND THRIVING CAMPUS COMMUNITY  I67
Additionally, the university should support more projects connecting the university with local 
and regional community audiences. Recent examples of these efforts include a Humanities Division event at the Museum of Art and History on Japanese American history, the National Endowment for the Humanities–supported Watsonville Is In the Heart collaboration, and the work of the African American Theater Arts Troupe in the Arts Division.
Beyond community outreach, the university should strengthen regional pipelines from 
the university to the community in the form of permanent budget line items for this work across all units on campus. For instance, the statewide report on Black reparations provides opportunities to broaden our campus members’ understanding of reparations as an anti-imperialist, anti-racist concept. The legacies of genocide, racism, xenophobia, and exclusion — and of the resistance and resilience of those who persevered — should be addressed more forthrightly through community partnerships.
The group acknowledged several challenges to achieving these goals, including limited 
funding, resistance to change, and the need for more awareness and support. To overcome these challenges, the group recommended leveraging existing resources and partnerships, engaging stakeholders in the process, and communicating the importance of DEI work to the campus community.
Metrics
•  S upport community-building events such as public fora, town halls, and leadership councils 
that unite our university leadership, faculty, staff, and students.
•  F
oster pipeline projects that connect the university with regional and local communities.
•  A

  CLIMATE CHANGE, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE  I69
Urgently addressing climate change requires multidisciplinary 
research-driven collaboration and collective action centered around climate justice. The committee recommended opportunities for faculty, staff, and students to discuss how the campus should approach climate change, sustainability, and resilience through our teaching, research, and campus operations over the next decade by:
•  Id entifying ways that UCSC can create and sustain a campus climate 
and culture that reduces environmental impacts while centering culturally relevant and inclusive sustainability, advancing climate justice, empowering students, and engaging local communities/partners, including Indigenous communities.
• 
 P
roposing undergraduate and graduate student learning 
opportunities, including curricular and extracurricular pathways (e.g., general education, experiential learning opportunities in natural and built environments, capstone projects, certificate programs, minors, or majors) by which all students would have an opportunity to learn about climate change science and policy, climate justice, resilience, and inclusive sustainability.
• 
 I
dentifying emerging or new collaborative interdisciplinary 
research areas related to climate change, climate justice, resilience, and/or inclusive sustainability that advance  
UCSC’s mission and research leadership position.

Goals
GOAL 1  Build communities of care
Build communities of care, resilience, and preparedness in the face of climate change. 
UC Santa Cruz will empower faculty, staff, and students with the tools and resources to 
prepare for a changing world. The growing presence of climate anxiety on campus and ongoing social and ecological challenges is adding yet another burden to the already daunting task of tackling climate change and environmental injustices worldwide.  
Enhancing awareness and institutional and individual preparedness regarding emergency planning and training efforts in relation to wildfire, drought, and flooding is critical. Being 
cared for, educated, and prepared will empower UCSC community members to serve more effectively in their important roles as teachers, researchers, staff members, administrators, 
and students.
Increasing the availability of mental health resources and physical spaces dedicated to 
self-care at UCSC will be essential. Climate anxiety is not relegated only to environmentally minded community members. Reaching all those on campus who experience climate anxiety will require a diverse set of culturally relevant approaches and collaboration with offices and units not traditionally associated with sustainability, climate change, and resilience, such as Counseling and Psychological Services.
At UCSC, we are uniquely positioned through our curricular and co-curricular programming 
to educate on climate change and resilience, and we can further build upon those strengths 
and increase the availability of operational resources to achieve this goal. Active engagement with climate solutions is essential to empowering our students, staff, and faculty while 
highlighting the significant work already underway and the challenges the university faces in climate adaptation.
In addition to making a curricular commitment to students, strategies to achieve this goal 
will include enhancing existing and building new educational resources through the myriad of cross-divisional co-curricular programs, departments, and colleges across campus, including numerous research and teaching centers, and campus organizations such as the People of Color Sustainability Collective, the Sustainability Office, Center for Agroecology, Arboretum, Natural Reserve System, Operations, and Staff Advisory Board. 
It is equally important that UCSC advances justice-centered and equitable approaches to 
its sustainable operations, services, and programs if we are to effectively build diverse and meaningful communities of care. UCSC will increase the availability and optimize the distribution of resources to support access to safe, sustainable, and equitable campus housing. Additionally, our campus will center social justice and Indigenous knowledge practices in its approaches to sustainability and resilience policies and programs.
I  LEADING THE CHANGE72

  CLIMATE CHANGE, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE  I73
Finally, it will be crucial to engage and partner with local and regional climate change and 
resiliency efforts to exchange information, better understand regional climate challenges, and create a forum for potential collaboration on solutions. The campus will also communicate transparently to a broad audience about its progress in advancing the strategic plan goals for Climate Change, Resilience, and Sustainability. UCSC will maintain effective technological tools and utilize modern, culturally relevant communication channels on a predictable, ongoing basis to communicate key performance metrics and progress on goals.

GOAL 2 Decarbonize UC Santa Cruz 
UCSC to build an equitable, accessible, and fossil-free future. 
UCSC must address its own role in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions to 
comprehensively combat climate change. The associated health issues, extreme weather disasters, loss of land and homes, and economic consequences of climate change impact under-resourced communities and people of color first and worst. This issue also hits home for many students, faculty, and staff who come to UCSC from a wide array of personal backgrounds and diverse communities across the globe. Becoming fossil-free in the long term will significantly reduce the university’s contributions to the environmental injustices associated with burning fossil fuels worldwide. These efforts will include increasing the pace of energy efficiency measures, adopting renewable energy sources, installing electrical vehicle 
I  LEADING THE CHANGE74
charging infrastructure, rolling out an all-electric bus fleet, reducing reliance on vehicles, and 
ultimately working toward ending the campus’s consumption of fossil fuels. 
The university must achieve this goal while simultaneously strengthening power resilience to 
maintain the integrity of academic research, teaching, and safety in the face of increasingly frequent power outages as the campus grows to educate and house more students. UCSC  
will explore technologies and innovations to increase power resilience, such as developing micro-grids, installing battery storage, and more. Decarbonization also presents another opportunity for innovative research and for students to practically apply classroom knowledge in the field by using the campus as a living-learning laboratory and encouraging interdisciplinary innovation in the campus’s day-to-day operations.
Uncertainty regarding the effective deployment of new technologies and ways of doing 
business on this scale will inevitably arise as the campus overhauls infrastructure, processes, and practices that have been in place for several decades. The campus’s electrical service infrastructure will require significant upgrades to accommodate the electrification of all campus energy use, the electrification of the bus and vehicle fleet, and providing more EV charging for personal vehicles. The campus will also implement best practices in change management and employ an intentional workforce development approach focused on the 
principles of a just transition. To support these myriad efforts, the university will take advantage 
of the increasing funding opportunities, grants, and state and national incentives focused on advancing decarbonization and electrification.

GOAL 3  Steward the water and land 
Steward the water and land to support healthy social and environmental ecosystems. 
UCSC is situated in a unique location, with spectacular vistas of the ocean at the 
intersection of many different habitats, including redwood forest and open meadows, natural and built lands, multiple watershed drainages, and limestone karst topography. 
This exceptional environment has offered opportunities to build bridges between teaching, research, and operations while promoting land stewardship and supporting student learning 
by leveraging the campus as a living laboratory, most notably through programs and 
courses at the Center for Agroecology, the Arboretum, and the Campus Natural Reserves. UCSC will expand upon the existing work with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band on campus, such as at the Arboretum, to increase Indigenous engagement, including working with the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band to provide land access, provide cultural expertise support on projects, and to help steward ecosystems with traditional ecological practices.
Effective stewardship at UCSC will involve a variety of strategies to support biodiversity and 
preserve habitats while simultaneously increasing housing and enhancing accessible, safe 
  CLIMATE CHANGE, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE  I77
circulation pathways for active transportation and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
needs and supporting sustainable and accessible transportation options such as walking, biking, and mass transit. Additionally, increasing charging stations for electric vehicles and bus fleets will be essential as the campus continues to grow. A comprehensive Habitat Conservation Plan for the Residential (Main) Campus and Westside Research Park will include a conservation strategy for endangered and threatened species, and a Wildfire Vegetation Management Plan will enhance UCSC’s climate resilience. Additionally, Indigenous knowledge practices, traditional ecological management practices, cultural preservation of known archaeological sites, and dedicated land access for the Amah Mutsun will be essential to merging environmental justice practices with existing sustainable land stewardship practices at UCSC. 
Increasing temperatures and long-term drought necessitate that UCSC continues to 
serve as a leader in best practices in water management. In the decade ahead, water conservation measures will be ongoing, including the reduction of irrigation for ornamental landscaping. The campus will explore potential non-potable and recycled water sources to reduce reliance on treated drinking water from the City of Santa Cruz for various irrigation applications, including growing food and maintaining landscapes. Non-potable water options for the campus to explore through the Non-Potable Water Master Plan include groundwater, gray and black water treatment facilities, and dual water infrastructure systems to pipe graywater for toilet flushing and landscaping.

I  LEADING THE CHANGE78
GOAL 4 Advance a circular economy
Advance a circular economy in the consumption cycle.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (2022) defines a circular economy as one that 
reduces material use; redesigns materials, products, and services to be less resource 
intensive; and recaptures “waste” as a resource to manufacture new materials and products. The purchase, consumption, and disposal of goods on campus enable the university to meet its important teaching and research mission but also directly contribute to the environmental footprint of UCSC. 
The consumption life cycle begins with procurement, which presents an opportunity to 
use UCSC’s spending power to influence our vendors. Choosing companies that integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles into their operations; that are small, local, and/or diverse businesses; and that sell products that are transparent about their supply chain and its related environmental and social impacts will enable UCSC to use its financial 
resources to support sustainability-minded companies. The Central 
Coast region has a myriad of small-scale, minoritized growers practicing organic climate-
smart agricultural practices. UCSC’s operational commitment to these local producers 
will support the campus’s regional standing, continue to position UCSC as a leader in 
sustainable and socially aligned food purchasing, and further support recruitment and retention efforts in the south Santa Cruz County area. 
Following the acquisition of products, how they are consumed can reduce UCSC’s environmental footprint. This includes buying energy- or water-efficient equipment and 
purchasing products that come in minimal packaging. Extending the useful life of products through reuse and refurbishment can reduce the need to purchase new items, thus reducing resource use. Creating a campus ecosystem that supports reuse is essential. This includes maximizing capacity for reusing a wide variety of items, such as the creation of donation spaces, supporting an effective campus surplus operation, installing additional water bottle filling stations, and making utility sinks in residence halls easily accessible to enable proper cleaning of reusable eating ware. 
A consistent, accessible, and convenient waste system for items at the end of their useful 
lives will provide campus users with a simple process to dispose of the most common waste items. This requires zero-waste stations (recycling, compost, and landfill) with effective signage sized appropriately for the space and prominent for campus users to locate. Specifically, UCSC must increase the number of compost bins across all areas of campus to match landfill and recycling bin availability.
Not only is waste a resource and a land use issue, but waste is also a climate change issue, 
as waste disposal creates greenhouse gases. For example, organic waste that enters a landfill decomposes to generate methane gas, a significantly more potent greenhouse 
  CLIMATE CHANGE, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE  I79
gas than carbon dioxide. Tracking waste and progress to meeting the UC’s waste goals will 
contribute to a more comprehensive accounting of UCSC’s Scope 3 emissions.  
Significant education and outreach tailored to various groups of campus users are needed 
to meet UCSC’s waste goals. This will not only educate the campus about how to sort waste 
properly, but also reduce the amount of waste generated by focusing on intentional purchasing 
and using resources such as Campus Surplus to reuse items and CruzBuy to facilitate and track sustainable spending.

GOAL 5 Teach students about climate change 
Ensure that all students graduate with a transdisciplinary understanding of climate change grounded in justice, experiential learning, and diverse approaches to knowledge. 
UCSC must ensure that all students graduate with an understanding of climate change that 
is transdisciplinary, epistemologically diverse, and rooted in climate justice and experiential learning. This education must also enable students to critically evaluate whether certain responses and solutions are effective, equitable, and sufficient. Building on our existing strengths in climate science, pursuing this goal will position UCSC to lead the nation in preparing the next generation of innovative and equity-minded leaders in climate response across all workforce sectors. Epistemologically diverse approaches are critical in training the next generation of climate leaders. It demands both strengthening and indigenizing UCSC’s climate education and learning opportunities to ensure that students understand scientific ways of knowing and artistic, humanistic, and justice-centered approaches to understanding and responding to climate change. Centrally, this training must also include Indigenous ways of knowing and Indigenous climate justice, emphasizing how harms 
  CLIMATE CHANGE, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE  I81
resulting from historical and structural processes related to settler 
colonialism must be addressed to effectively and equitably tackle climate change. Experiential learning is central to this approach.
UCSC should develop a required basic curriculum that exposes all  
undergraduate students to climate change and climate justice. The  curriculum should be designed via a bottom-up process, co-designed 
with deep collaboration from all five divisions, the Colleges, the Senate,   
the Teaching and Learning Center, and staff and student representatives  
through a task force created for this purpose. We urge against a model that loosely knits together professors from various disciplines 
in diverse but unconnected guest lectures. Instead, we encourage the CP/EVC to provide course development resources that would compensate faculty and lecturers across all five divisions and the 
colleges to co-develop learning outcomes and content collaboratively. 
Recognizing that careful curriculum development takes time and community engagement, and also the urgency of climate change, while the new curriculum is being developed, all incoming first-year students should be required to take one existing course related to climate change and/or climate justice (to be identified by the task force). We encourage departments (with populous majors) to add at least one climate-related course to their major requirements. In addition, degree programs should provide students with opportunities to dive deeper into climate change from multiple perspectives, including creating new interdisciplinary majors and minors, new climate-related tracks or courses within existing majors, or new certificate programs. Finally, experiential programming that centers on climate justice could be integrated beyond coursework through summer internship experiences and Summer Bridge programs.
At the graduate level, students should have access to training and 
information on how their discipline relates to climate change and on climate-related career pathways for their particular degree. A regular cross-campus speaker series on climate change and access to a centralized resource that connects faculty in different disciplines with climate change themes in their research would support this goal. To strengthen and diversify graduate student research on climate justice and resilience, the Cota-Robles Fellowship program should be expanded to include two additional fellowships for climate justice and resilience-focused graduate students. There may also be opportunities to engage with UCSC alumni working in climate justice Should UCSC enhance 
opportunities for  
learning with climate-re
lated themes?
Almost half of undergraduate 
students (46%), a third of  
graduate students (36%), and a t
hird of Senate faculty believe 
that UCSC should enhance opportunities for community engagement and experiential learning with climate change, climate justice, or climate resilience-related themes by supporting existing programs and funding new ones.UNDERGRADUATE

GOAL 6 Advance sustainability and climate change research 
Expand, value, and incentivize collaborative, solution-oriented, justice-centered, and diverse research approaches to climate change and sustainability.   
UCSC should incentivize interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations. In recognizing 
and valuing diverse approaches to knowledge, UCSC will be positioned as a global leader in understanding the interactions between physical drivers and biological impacts with climate change's social, political, and justice dimensions. This necessary shift is gaining interest and support across policy, academia, the private sector, the arts, and the public. 
UCSC should identify and make visible the myriad climate-related instructors, courses, 
research activities, artistic projects, programs, and ways of knowing that exist across campus. A crucial first step is expanding existing efforts to map faculty research across 
I  LEADING THE CHANGE84
the divisions; this will involve working toward a database and accessible online search tool. 
Augmenting this digital infrastructure with physical spaces and regular community-building events that connect diverse researchers, artists, students, community partners, and others offers an exciting opportunity to actively encourage novel collaborative relationships and research projects. Regular community building programs should be supported by dedicated staff and be designed and hosted in collaboration with all five divisions, with co-sponsorship by one or more centers/institutes across campus.
UCSC must also transform institutional incentives to encourage and reward diverse forms 
of collaboration in climate change, sustainability, and resilience-related research. For all its proven value in fostering original, solutions-oriented research, collaboration does not always find supportive conditions, especially in some fields where individualized research and creative practice are more highly rewarded. Collaborative and justice-oriented research entails a necessary level of intellectual and professional risk and requires time and energy. Potential responses to these barriers include course releases, seed funding, and a task force led by the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor and the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, and including members of the Senate Committee on Academic Personnel (CAP) on amending merit review criteria to reward such work. UCSC should also enhance and expand administrative support structures for transdisciplinary grant writing and management.
  CLIMATE CHANGE, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RESILIENCE  I85
Collaborative and diverse, solutions-oriented research can also be enhanced by building 
on and expanding existing structures for community-engaged research and partnerships. UCSC should leverage existing expertise on campus to develop training resources in community-engaged research, including for STEM researchers; create mechanisms for participant compensation; and set aside project development funding to enable UCSC researchers to engage community partners meaningfully. UCSC should also create a residential activist and community scholar program. 
Incentivizing community-based and epistemologically diverse research will also help UCSC 
to ameliorate harms resulting from knowledge production's extractive nature. Climate research and action that advances justice, and does not reinforce injustice, is predicated on eliminating these harms. UCSC should ensure that its research provides multiple forms of benefits to research participants and partners, thereby enhancing UCSC’s relations with its community partners. This includes engaging in reciprocity agreements with research participants to ensure that their community needs are met. This could be catalyzed through discussion and training on research ethics and diverse approaches to climate research. 
A newly funded Center for Climate Justice, with focal areas in, among others, Indigenous 
climate justice and climate resilience, would play a pivotal role in celebrating and rewarding the diversity in research that is necessary to address climate change effectively. It would further place UCSC at the forefront of innovative and impactful social justice–oriented research on climate change, sustainability, and resilience. The new center must have a structure, staff composition, and mission tailored to advancing climate justice. This would require the Center for Climate Justice to be established as a new entity separate from the Center for Coastal Climate Resilience, which has a different mission. However, the two centers may collaborate to maximize their impact. 
The campus community identified several other strategies that should also be considered to  
achieve this goal. These include altering UCSC’s divisional structure by creating a School of the 
Environment; leveraging the new Center for Coastal Climate Resilience to spearhead research 
collaboration; reinstating positions for Professors of Practice across divisions and disciplines, 
including in climate justice, Indigenous studies, and climate science; expanding faculty expertise  
related to climate justice, for example by conducting an interdisciplinary cluster hire focused on climate justice; and incentivizing graduate student-faculty research collaboration and mentorship by creating new GSR positions, particularly in underfunded divisions.

GOAL 7 Forge relationships with Indigenous communities 
With an ethos of reciprocity and respect, forge relationships with Indigenous peoples/organizations that enable the co-production of knowledge and action plans toward climate justice.   
Mainstream approaches to climate change response have focused 
on greening our economy and technological responses that merely reproduce the social problems that make climate change such an intractable problem to solve without addressing ongoing and historical causes of harm. “Colonialism is not a historical event, but an ongoing set of relations that still characterize the common sense of professional science” (Liboiron, 2021). Such colonial relations are seen in the mundane workings of the university, manifesting the assumed universal superiority of Western ways of knowing and doing. For generations, research has benefited from and taken access to Indigenous lands, lives, and knowledge for granted. As scientists and scholars, we have 71%

inherited these practices and worldviews that have dismissed Indigenous science and ways 
of knowing as insufficient; that presume the right to collect, extract, control, and display items taken from Indigenous lands and bodies without consent (ProPublica, 2023), including within the UC system (Hudetz et al., 2023); and that erase Indigenous relationships to land and non-human relatives through practices such as colonial place names. To address these forms of harm, UCSC must signal its commitment to Indigenous science to begin a reversal of the erasure of Indigenous peoples’ culture and history. This is a commitment toward more just land relations and confronting the dominant knowledge paradigm that presumes entitlement to Indigenous land, life, and knowledge (Liboiron, 2021).  
As we state in our land acknowledgement, UC Santa Cruz sits on “the unceded territory 
of the Awaswas-speaking Uypi tribe. The Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, comprised of the descendants of Indigenous people taken to missions Santa Cruz and San Juan Bautista during the Spanish colonization of the Central Coast, is today working hard to restore traditional stewardship practices on these lands and heal from historical trauma.” This statement speaks not only of the genocide of Indigenous peoples, but also of their survivance and continued commitment to sustain biocultural care in recognition of  the co-evolved relationships of humans and non-human kin. 
Faced with climate disruption, the power and potential of Indigenous ecological stewardship 
is increasingly recognized for its critical role in protecting the environment (Anderson, 2005; Cuthrell, 2013; Keeley, 2002). Indigenous knowledge systems that address climate change are situated in the dynamic intersections between land and sovereignty; the natural environment (including humans); institutions; technology (e.g., from GIS to tools to make birch bark canoes); economics (i.e., systems and interactions that prioritize collective well-being); and human perception, activity, and behavior. These approaches demonstrate a multiplicity of ways to care for the planet. Honoring and incorporating this conceptual, ideological, cultural, and linguistic diversity opens the possibility for more heterogeneous, nuanced, and contextualized efforts toward place-based, justice-centered sustainabilities and would reflect yet another way UC Santa Cruz exemplifies innovation and social equity. 
Centering and elevating these approaches also aligns with UCSC’s commitment to student 
success. Integrating interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary ways of knowing, including Indigenous science, is essential to training the leaders and change-makers of tomorrow.
