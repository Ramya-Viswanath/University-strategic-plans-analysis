How to Read this Strategic Plan
The Strategic Plan is a planning document which, within the framework of those standards 
established by the Articles, outlines a strategic vision for the University for the 2022- 2024 
period. The Plan identifies the main objectives and actions having a significant impact on the 
University’s ability to generate value for the public; it represents a reference for the Departments’ 
three-year Department plan, and identifies a path for interaction and synergy amongst various 
projects, developed both within and outside the University at various levels.
This Plan is the second promulgated during current rector’s term, and will mark an anticipatory 
conclusion to the 2020-2022 strategy period.
The Plan comprises eight areas: Internationalisation; Student Education and Services; Research; 
Third Mission; Healthcare; Italy’s resilience and recovery plan; A sustainable, student-centred 
university encompassing three campuses; Organisation, services, and rights. Each section 
provides a set of development and innovation objectives, along with performance indicators 
and targets, some of which are identified as of strategic significance under the Ministry’s Three-
Year Programme, and the University’s Quality Policies.
Efforts to generate the Strategic Plan began in July of 2021. The process to set these objectives 
included engagement from the academic community at large. Advice was sought from the 
governing bodies, academic departments, student representatives, university staff, as well as in 
the form of ongoing feedback from our stakeholders.
The Strategic Plan, although certainly the lodestar of the University’s vision and strategic 
trajectory, does not set forth the full spectrum of planning processes, and much less the tactics 
used on a daily basis to carry out the same. Rather, it is in an overview of the general strategy 
for the 2022- 2024 period. The detailed, exhaustive description of those processes, tactics, 
and objectives of University programming is supplied instead by University strategy documents 
taken as a whole:• the Financial Statements, which contain the designation of resources allocated to those 
tactics which are instrumental in the pursuit of strategic objectives. Moreover, the Financial 
Statements include a description of those resources needed to maintain the day-to-day 
operations of the University;
• the Ministry of Universities’ Three-Year Plan, through which University may assert its autonomy 
in terms of its internationalisation policies, educational offerings, student services, and in the 
development of personnel and research policies;
• the Integrated Activity and Organisation Plan, which notes those tactics (and related 
objectives, performance indicators, and targets) employed by the University Administration 
to reach strategic goals;
• University planning documents, including Strategic guidelines on academic offerings, the 
Three-year building plan;
• the Quality Policies document, which sets forth the basic standards on which University 
operations are predicated, and the procedures adopted to identify and to reach objectives in 
the service of constant improvement:
• the Department planning documents, including the Three-year department plan and the 
Excellence project plan for those departments receiving Ministry funding.
The Strategic Plan will be subject to six-monthly basis monitoring, the results of which, once 
reviewed at the administrative level, will be posted to the University’s web portal.

Strategic Plan 2022-20249 8
The European Universities programme, a bona fide “innovation 
laboratory”, will pave the way for a European Degree, and 
the development of an entirely new framework for the 
internationalisation of the European university system, to make 
it easier for students, faculty, and staff to travel, study, and work 
within the Union.
On a global scale, the University’s strategic objectives intend to 
provide a response to a series of seismic shifts within academia, 
starting with the urgent call to develop new forms of science 
diplomacy. These will allow universities to play a crucial role 
in tackling emergent challenges, and to foster common values 
including inter-generational dialogue.
On the whole, the University’s move towards internationalisation 
aligns with Italy’s Resilience and Recovery Plan, and its focus on 
increasing both the country’s competitive standing, as well as the 
international cooperation intrinsic to Italy’s economy. Through 
this objective, the University seeks to fulfil its role as a multi-
disciplinary, research-intensive, inclusive public university.As part of its overall strategy, the University of Milan intends 
to create a European and international space for teaching and 
research. This goal aligns with University’s role as a twenty-year 
member of LERU – League of European Research Universities 
– along with its other affiliations with international academic 
networks.
On the European side, the University’s internationalisation 
strategies accord with the European T ransformation Agenda 
for Higher Education, the primary goal for which is a sharp 
acceleration of the process to integrate the various national 
university systems to allow for greater synergy between teaching 
and research. A crucial component of that process has been the 
European Universities programme, in which the University 
has participated through its membership in the 4EU+ Alliance 
(along with the Sorbonne, and the Universities of Prague, 
Copenhagen, Warsaw, and Heidelberg). (https://www.UNIMI.it/

Student Education and Services
A general objective for the three-year period is therefore to 
create a seamless path forward in terms of the University’s 
commitment to further improving its academic programmes, 
and to making them sustainable in the long term; to apply 
a conscientious quality-assurance policy; to take a more 
international approach, and to expand its English-language 
offerings; to create opportunities for cross-pollination amongst 
the disciplines; to strengthen the University Education 
Incentive programming and student services; to increase post-
graduate offerings. Specific attention will be paid to issues 
of gender and other types of inclusivity on a policy level (in 
accordance with the University’s Gender Score Card).
Based on what we have accomplished thus far, and the 
strengths and weaknesses uncovered, an additional set of 
strategic objectives has been identified, and will be discussed 
below. The specific goal is to broaden access to a university 
education, improve accessibility and inclusion, and foster an 
environment of top-quality higher education focussed on 
innovation, evolution, and research, without sacrificing the 
relationship at the heart of the academic experience: that of 
students and teachers.The University of Milan is both a major university and a 
multi-disciplinary one. The University is positioned to offer 
a wide range of educational programming wherein the cross-
pollination of disciplines is highly encouraged. The University 
seeks to create an environment where in-class instruction is 
propelled by the most recent achievements in research.
The University’s commitment to continually improving 
its educational offerings, and to setting its students up for 
success in their work and careers, the current volatile climate 
notwithstanding, is unwavering.
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to enormous changes in 
teaching methods, and has prompted sizeable investments 
to make adjustments to our infrastructure and to harness 
new technologies. Experiences with blended and distance 
learning in recent months must be seized as an opportunity to 
strengthen and to renew the University’s overall instructional 
design. By the same token, attention must be paid to the 
development and implementation of new teaching methods, 
ones that increasingly place students’ learning process, and the 
development of their knowledge and skills, front and centre.

Research
and business, play a crucial role in this process. Over the 2022-
2024 period, UNIMI intends to provide a proactive response 
to the challenges and objectives set by Mission 4 (“M4) of 
Italy’s Resilience and Recovery Plan, producing programmes 
that align with the reforms and investments described in 
M4C4: RESEARCH FUELLING BUSINESS.
To allow for this kind of ongoing updates and adjustments 
to ensure our research complies with international standards, 
UNIMI believes its participation in TRAIN4EU+ – 
T ransforming ReseArch & INnovation agendas and support 
in 4EU+ to be of fundamental importance. Thanks to this 
programme, the University (along with the other five European 
university participants) has already launched a process for 
institutional and administrative change relating to its research 
and innovation infrastructure, and to its pursuit of Open 
Science goals.
The goals and action items are listed below in order of priority, 
predicated on overcoming current roadblocks that might stand 
in the way of the reforms and priorities appearing in the 2021-
2027 National Research Plan, and in Italy’s Resilience and 
Recovery Plan, as well as in the HorizonEurope guidelines. The 
common thread to all these objectives is fostering an inclusive 
and equitable environment to develop human capital and 
advanced training within the field of scientific research: goals 
which have been deemed highly strategic both for the 2021-
2027 National Research Plan as well as for Italy’s Resilience 
and Recovery Plan.The SARS-COV2 pandemic has shown that baseline scientific 
research can provide a solution (sometimes an immediate one) 
to unprecedented emergencies, and that the advancement of 
knowledge through curiosity-driven research is the essential 
prerequisite for generating innovation, and positive ripple 
effects within society. With that in mind, and as we enter a 
post-pandemic world, the University of Milan must establish 
a kind of osmosis amongst scientific research, the economy, 
and society (Responsible Research and Innovation), whilst 
maintaining a highly competitive level of research, conducted 
pursuant to international best practices on research quality, and 
the fundamentals of Open Science. This will ensure optimal 
use of the sizeable resources available under the 2021-2027 
National Research Plan (promulgated under the policies set by 
the European Research Area, and the “Next Generation Italy” 
Resilience and Recovery Plan. 
A paradigm shift within the culture is needed. We must 
unleash the potential for fundamental, targeted, and applied 
research in order to increase its impact on quality of life and 
the environment. This must be done at all levels: researchers 
and instructors; library, administrative, and technical 
staff; research services and deployment; advanced-training 
programmes; HR. Keeping pace with, and harnessing, 
technological advancements, the skills and talents of our 
human capital, and the development of new integrated models 
to support multi- and inter-disciplinary research, conducted 
through an organic partnership amongst academia, industry,

Third Mission
Our Third Mission has taken on a new dimension in these 
difficult times, meaning “social responsibility” has become 
an indispensable element to measure our impact, and is not 
limited to one specific discipline.
 
Keenly aware of its growing importance, both on a national 
and a European level, the University intends to pursue this 
third mission by instituting networks not only for the purpose 
of technology transfer, but also for sport and musical events, 
and for service to the community and to the prison population.
 
UNIMI breaks down its Third Mission by identifying five 
strategic areas of focus for the next three years. The fifth 
objective (new to this strategic plan) takes into account issues 
of gender equality, which are becoming increasingly important 
on a global level, Italy’s Resilience and Recovery Plan included. 
To reach these five objectives, UNIMI has vested itself with a 
series of flexible and effective tools: the recent transformation 
of Fondazione Filarete/Filarete Servizi srl into the Fondazione 
UNIMI (which is a fully held subsidiary of the university), 
establishing a network of department points of contact for 
the Third Mission, and the organisation of an internal 
data-collection procedure.Third Mission (also known as University Innovation and 
Community Leadership), albeit an evolving notion that 
embraces a number of diverse areas, today represents an 
important role the university fills, in terms of its socio-
economic impacts and responsibilities. “Third Mission” means 
a set of operations through which the University interacts 
directly with society, in its proactive role as a cultural engine for 
the local and academic community. “Third Mission” is where 
the University fosters an exchange of ideas and interactions 
with community members, business leaders, and local 
government, in the pursuit of sustainable societal innovation.
 
In keeping with the European Innovation Council policy 
(https://eic.ec.europa.eu/index_en) and the 2021-27 National 
Research Plan, the notion of technology transfer has been 
gradually replaced by the idea of knowledge being exchanged 
along a two-way street. Taking that approach, the University 
works to listen to the community’s needs, and to embrace the 
talent and skills offered by all stakeholders. This philosophy 
makes it possible to generate projects that have a positive 
impact on the community (e.g. Quick Transfer of Knowledge for 
Citizens Framework Programme https://www.mur.gov.it/sites/
default/files/2021-08/1. AllegatoEsteso_Salute.pdf).

Healthcare
Policies for the development of any hospital which acts as a 
teaching hospital for a degree programme must be grounded 
on a minimum set of instructional objectives, which cannot be 
infringed by any business policy within the hospital.
Specifically, Operational Units (OU) which are functional 
to a degree programmes cannot be eliminated; tutors must 
always be in sufficient supply, and have adequate professional 
experience.
Amongst the objectives in the healthcare arena are those 
intended to foster interdisciplinary exchanges and to create 
organic opportunities for the exchange of ideas and the 
development of research proposals. The University is uniquely 
poised to cultivate the kind of internal synergy seldom found 
outside of academia, and never with the same calibre of talent. 
The instructors of the University of Milan have for some time 
been involved in public engagement activities, in collaboration 
with NGOs in Italy and abroad, in international-cooperation 
programmes in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These efforts 
include prevention and training operations undertaken 
in collaboration with volunteer associations. Within the 
University Third Mission programme there are, furthermore, 
conferences and training opportunities for “lay persons”, 
including Life Long Learning, clinical trials, international 
cooperation, and programmes for working students.
Activities within the Healthcare Area will unfold, over the next 
few years, according to policy and strategic lines which we 
summarise below.The University plays an outsize role in the region’s public 
healthcare system.
During the pandemic, UNIMI provided direct support in the 
form of its medical students (in specialised training) and the 
faculty from its medical school stationed within Lombardy’s 
hospitals. They played a crucial role, on both the treatment and 
research sides, for some of the nation’s hospitals hardest-hit by 
the pandemic. University instructors on the front lines have 
been recognised by numerous accolades, and a number of major 
projects spearheaded by UNIMI (some of which have been 
integrated into the region’s permanent healthcare policies) have 
been launched.
With a view toward constantly improving the quality of the 
education in the medical degree programmes, and post-graduate 
programmes, and because of that indispensable connection 
between the University’s academic activities, and the hospitals 
and clinics of the Regional Health System where residencies 
and other professional experiences take place, the goal will 
be to fortify the institutional relationship with the Region of 
Lombardy and the various (public and private) hospitals and 
clinics which are already a part of the academic network, whilst 
at the same time reaffirming the University’s institutional 
mission  (teaching and research). In that respect, one of the 
primary objectives will be to execute a framework agreement (as 
discussed and implemented as part of the prior strategic plan) 
that maintains, and in fact improves, the relationship between 
the hospitals and clinics identified by the Region of Lombardy 
as satellite campuses for the needs of the Degree Programmes.

Italy’s resilience and recovery plan
On the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic, the European Union 
(EU) launched the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme 
in order to accelerate the area’s ecological and digital transition, 
to improve its work force, and to pursue greater equality across 
genders, regions, and generations.
Italy has received a substantial benefit from this programme 
(191.5 billion Euro to be utilised over the 2021-2026 period). 
The investment of these sizeable resources (which exceed 10% of 
Italy’s GNP), represents a unique opportunity for our country in 
terms of development, innovation, and reform. Italy’s Resilience 
and Recovery Plan will guide these efforts. The University of 
Milan intends to play a leading role in the Plan by deploying its 
own departments and administrative infrastructure in the pursuit 
of the Plan’s ambitious objectives. To ensure that the University 
can offer an innovative and significant contribution in terms 
of research, training, and its third mission, the University has 
already launched, and will soon be optimising, a series of support 
operations.

Strategic Plan 2022-202433 32
Italy’s resilience and recovery plan
Governance open to innovation 
The challenge posed by Italy’s Resilience and Recovery Plan to the public administration is to 
establish governance open to working and cooperating with other institutions in the pursuit of 
public-policy goals. In response, the University has enacted certain coordination mechanisms for 
the interactions amongst its governing bodies, administration, and departments. Moreover, the 
University will establish a set of legal entities (including companies, foundations, associations, 
consortia, and partnerships) which – as contemplated by both the law and published guidelines 
– will facilitate the pursuit of the Plan’s objectives. Operational authority will be allocated based 
on the complexity, quality, and variety of projects to be completed, and will allow for responsive 
interaction with other universities and/or other public and private institutions. Action items will 
be implemented in accordance with the timetables set by Italy’s Resilience and Recovery Plan.

A sustainable,
student-centred university 
encompassing three campuses
In its previous strategic plan (2020-2022), UNIMI delineated a 
broad and ambitious strategy to build a tri-campus university. 
This strategy (taken up and relaunched by the current Strategic 
Plan), involves the design, construction, and management (on both 
a facilities as well as organisational level) of the new Campus Mind, 
and the scientific platforms that will be implemented in the same, as 
well as the repurposing of the downtown and Città Studi campuses.
The University’s three-campus structure can be delineated as follows: 
1) Campus MIND: situated within the innovation district (the new 
site for the faculties of sciences)
2) Città Studi campus: a new Humanities Campus will be built, 
subject to available funding, authorised by a series of resolutions 
passed by the Academic Bodies. The first to transfer will be Cultural 
Heritage, with other humanities and linguistics departments to 
follow, and will be sited at locations on long-term lease from the 
state. Following that will be the Digital Campus, intended for 
the acquisition, archiving, and computational analysis of research 
findings, telemedicine services, and Inclusive UNIMI, at the Celoria 
and Golgi locations.
3) Downtown: Via Festa del Perdono, Via Mercalli (Santa Sofia 
campus), Piazza S. Alessandro, Via Conservatorio, Campus 
Policlinico (Office of the Rector, University Administration, 
and part of the Faculties of Humanities, Medicine, and Dentistry).
The construction design that will make the three-campus structure 
a reality places special focus on environmental sustainability and 
the university education incentive programme. These will be 
student-centred spaces.

Organisation, services, and rights
The restructuring process within the University Administration, 
a large portion of which has already been completed, will require 
a series of corrective actions to keep pace with a new reality inside 
and outside of academia, resulting from major shifts in the 
socio-economic and political climate. Yet a public entity is never 
static: its organisation is a dynamic process that reacts in an agile 
way to the changing landscape.
The current organisational model, with its focus on quality, 
transversal policies, and competencies, and in developing a more 
forward-thinking approach in the top tiers of management, 
has lent itself to some fine tuning in certain areas which have 
not yet, from a management and functional standpoint, reached 
their full potential. We will, for example, be optimising our 
internal and external communication, through efforts which 
include a specific “Communication and Event Management 
Division”, slated to be launched by the end of January 2022. 
Additionally, the plan is to establish an Office of General Counsel, 
for the purpose of improving the quality and autonomy of the 
University’s management of legal issues and rights; the design and 
implementation of a new Operations Centre for the management 
of Farming Businesses; finally, with a view towards optimising 
the University’s role within the greater Milanese community, 
the integration of the UNIMI’s library system with the network 
of local libraries.
