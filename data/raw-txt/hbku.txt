Critical Success Factors
It is imperative that key success factors are in place for successful implementation 
of the strategic plan. 
A. Sustainable, High-Quality Academic Programs
Consistency of Academic Quality
§ Demand  for global tertiary education outstrips supply. In  addition, there is a skills 
gap between the education sector and the 21st century skill requirements of the 
market. HBKU’s focus will be in key areas in a multi-disciplinary and innovative 
approach.
§ The region suffers from a deficiency of PhDs thus HBKU will concentrate on 
offering PhDs that are vital to the region. Five percent of any nation’s population 
need to be PhD holders for a knowledge-based economy to be realized. HBKU will 
support this important goal for Qatar. 
§ According to the higher education landscape report, there is a pool of eligible 
youth in the region for admission into HBKU. Thus, there is a high potential of 
HBKU tapping into this pool of local and regional students, attracting them with 
the right programs and tools.
Quality of Feeder Programs
§ Strategically building strong preparation programs and outreach programs to 
prepare Qatar’s K-12 students for higher education with partners and relevant
