WELCOME
Further education transforms the 
lives of young people and adults 
through learning and creates 
opportunities that some may never 
have thought possible.
At The Sheffield College, we’re proud of the 
fact that further education colleges in England 
educate and train 2.2 million young people and 
adults every year. 
Colleges also educate more young people 
than state funded schools, according to the 
Association of Colleges, and more large 
employers train their staff via colleges than via 
universities.
The Sheffield College is no exception, being 
one of three anchor education institutions in 
the city alongside both of the universities. 
We know that education drives opportunities 
and transforms life chances and careers. We 
are immensely proud to be at the heart of our 
fantastic city and communities.
Our new Strategic Plan 2021-2025 sets out how 
we intend to accelerate that via four  
 
 
 
 
 key ambitions based on learning, people, 
partnerships and sustainability.
At The Sheffield College, we focus on careers 
not just courses. Our students achieve so 
much more than a qualification - growing in 
aspirations and confidence and looking to the 
future with optimism.
The majority of our students are local and are 
the city’s talent pool and employees of the 
future. We offer a huge range of vocational, 
technical and academic qualifications to help 
young people and adults go further from entry 
through to degree level. 
We work with around 2,400 employers and 
are the largest apprenticeship provider in the 
city and South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined 
Authority. 
We have made great strides with award-winning 
initiatives and thanks to the dedication and 
commitment of our amazing staff - but we are 
not complacent. We want to achieve more.
Our new strategy demonstrates our students 
first ethos and commitment to increasing our 
positive impact on the communities that we 
serve and being part of the skills-led pandemic 
economic recovery that our city, region and 
country urgently need.

sector but most employment is within the service sector, 
particularly in health, social care and finance
