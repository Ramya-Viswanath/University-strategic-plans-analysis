OVERVIEW
2
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS  
AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT  
AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE. 
We are a place of learning: a school 
dedicated to the art and science of 
education and committed to reimagining 
teaching and learning inside both 
classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the 
indisputable value of science and 
humanities, inquiry and creativity, 
and comprising tens of thousands of 
searchers and discoverers working in 
hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and 
collaborative spaces. Strategically  
located just a few miles from the nation’s 
capital, our university is a place where 
new knowledge is pursued, discovered, 
and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half 
a million members strong, of diverse 
students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a 
small city of residents and commuters, 
first responders and health care workers, 
learners, artists, and athletes; a place 
where thousands come to work every 
day to make a difference. Our diversity is 
integral to our excellence. And ours is a 
community that is intrinsically connected 
to our surrounding neighborhoods and 
our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains,  
since our founding, an institution of 
change and progress, and a proud land-
grant flagship campus dedicated to  
the public good. 
Our university is evolving faster than 
at any moment in its storied history. 
Our guiding principles are helping us to 
empower the next generation of leaders, 
artists, writers, educators, scientists, 
and global citizens to develop creative 
solutions to the grand challenges of  
our times.

to fearlessly forge a better world for 
all humankind.

We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal 
inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and 
because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD  IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND 
STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our 
mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless: 
   OUR VISION:  
TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF EVERY PERSON ON EARTH, WE WILL REIMAGINE TEACHING AND LEARNING; ACCELERATE 
SOLUTIONS TO THE GRAND CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME THROUGH CREATIVITY AND DISCOVERY; AND FORGE A 
DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY WHERE OUR DIFFERENCES ARE CELEBRATED AND EQUITY IS RELENTLESSLY 
PURSUED. TOGETHER, WE WILL DEDICATE OURSELVES TO ADVANCING THE PUBLIC GOOD BECAUSE OUR INDIVIDUAL 
WELL-BEING IS ENDURINGLY BOUND TO OUR COLLECTIVE WELL-BEING.
