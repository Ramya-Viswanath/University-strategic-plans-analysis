Universiti Malaya
Strategic Plan
2021-2025


Foreword from Chairman of                  
Universiti Malaya
Board of Directors
Assalammualaikum wbt and 
Greetings,
The Universiti Malaya’s (UM) 
Strategic Plan 2021-2025 is 
the initial phase of a ten-year 
Transformation Plan that will run 
into 2030. By that time UM should 
be well on the way towards 
realising its vision of becoming a 
global university that is impacting 
the world. 
UM has already gained wide 
recognition as the top university 
in Malaysia. This achievement 
comes with many heavy 
responsibilities. In my mind its 
foremost intellectual role is to 
provide sustained leadership 
based on its special strengths.
Major changes are taking place 
around the world. These changes 
demand that we take proactive 
steps to organise ourselves 
so that we may produce more 
beneficial outcomes that may lead 
to greater impacts on the wider 
community.
The emerging global system has 
repositioned knowledge as the 
primary source of value creation. 
Whether we are dealing with 
economic value or other kinds of 
value, knowledge will increase in 
importance.Knowledge is at the heart of UM’s 
functions and activities. Whether 
in teaching, research or public 
engagement, UM possesses 
unique knowledge about the 
human and natural environments 
that it has been operating in. 
This stock of knowledge should 
be widely shared and applied 
innovatively to create value to 
society.
Knowledge resides in people. 
Each individual has a distinct 
understanding of what is 
important or relevant in any 
particular context. For this reason, 
it is not feasible to manage a 
knowledge-based organisation 
according to strict hierarchy. A 
better way is to recognise each 
person’s unique strength as a 
subject matter expert while at 
the same time building multi-
disciplinary teams of equally 
accomplished experts focused on 
the delivery of well-defined goals 
and targets. By mobilising the 
specific knowledge of individual 
actors through systematic 
integration and consolidation, we 
will be able to create a dynamic, 
people-driven organisation for 
value creation.YM Tengku Datuk Dr. Mohd 
Azzman Shariffadeen Tengku 
Ibrahim
Chairman, 
UM Board of Directors
(Nov 2018 - Oct 2021)

Transformation has to begin with 
personal change. Behavioural 
changes individually and 
collectively will naturally arise 
when an adaptive and agile 
organisational ecosystem is put in 
place to promote creative thinking 
and entrepreneurial work delivery. 
Empowered staff who are creative 
and entrepreneurial in addressing 
critical issues and challenges will 
naturally find leadership roles. As 
more staff learn the new way of 
working UM will see the rise of 
agile networks of value-creating 
teams centred around knowledge 
and expertise.
This booklet serves to explain 
and clarify the meaning and 
implications of many of the 
transformative ideas that underlie 
the strategic planning work 
conducted thus far. As we move 
forward there will be many more 
concepts and frameworks that will 
need to be shared.A journey of a thousand miles 
begins with a single step. UM 
has embarked on the journey 
by mobilising an initial team of 
leaders to collaborate freely and 
closely in an environment that 
promotes creativity and openness 
without fear of failure. I am hopeful 
that this new work culture will 
become the norm among UM 
people across the board. 
This booklet is the result of 
intense effort by teams of 
dedicated staff who have 
taken on their respective roles 
and responsibilities with great 
enthusiasm, energy and discipline. 
They have received strong 
support from the alumni as well as 
many other external partners and 
collaborators. I thank them all for 
their contributions.
I look forward to witnessing the 
rebirth of UM, even stronger in 
intellectual accomplishment, and 
ready to take on the challenge of 
impacting the world. 
Message from the 
Vice-Chancellor
I would like to express my 
sincere gratitude and thanks to 
everyone involved in our Strategic 
Plan, especially the Chairman 
and members of UM Board of 
Directors, for their unwavering 
support and guidance. Likewise, 
our deep appreciation to all 
members of the UM management 
team, Task force leaders and 
members, and everyone that has 
contributed their ideas, valuable 
time, and resources in the various 
stages of the formulation of this 
Strategic Plan.
Let us work together in a 
concerted and strategic manner 
to deliver the best teaching and 
learning ecosystem to all our 
stakeholders in order to achieve 
our vision of being a global 
university that is impacting the 
world. 
Thank you.Assalammualaikum wbt and 
Salam Sejahtera, 
The Universiti Malaya Strategic 
Plan Booklet, which outlines 
more than 100 strategic initiatives 
under the 5 pillars, serves as a 
reference to all members of the 
UM community in our aspiration 
to become a global university. 
The purpose of this document is 
to chart the planned and co-
ordinated implementation of all the 
strategic initiatives identified as 
part of institutional reform, mainly 
in Income Generation, Teaching 
& Learning, Research Innovation, 
Talent, and Entrepreneurship, that 
will elevate this institution to the 
next level. 
Indeed, UM has come a long 
way since we started on our 
journey, and we are very happy 
with the progress that we have 
achieved so far; we look forward 
to the next stages of effective 
implementation. We believe 
our mission of ‘Pushing the 
boundaries of knowledge and 
nurturing aspiring leaders’ will 
produce the right human talent 
for the future: individuals who 
possess the right values and a 
deep understanding of the world, 
and are capable of contributing 
effectively to the global 
community. Professor Dato' Ir. Dr. Mohd 
Hamdi Abd Shukor
Vice-Chancellor UM


The University of Malaya was 
founded in Singapore on the 28th 
of September 1905 as the King 
Edward VII College of Medicine. 
The name University of Malaya was 
first used on the 8th of October 1949 
with the merger of the King Edward 
VII College of Medicine and Raffles 
College (established in 1928). Its 
establishment marked the dawn 
of unprecedented advancement 
in education in Malaya, and led 
eventually to the founding of two 
autonomous branches in Kuala 
Lumpur and Singapore in 1959. 
With the passing of the University of 
Malaya Act in 1961 by parliament, 
The University of Malaya, also known 
as Universiti Malaya (UM), was 
recognised as a public university in 
the Federation of Malaya from the 1st 
of January 1962. This makes UM the 
oldest public university in Malaysia. 
UM’s Coat of Arms bears the 
university’s motto, ‘Ilmu Puncha 
Kemajuan’, which translates to "Knowledge is the Source of 
Progress". Throughout her more 
than one century of existence, UM 
has transformed from a university 
with the initial objective of nation 
building, to a nexus of knowledge. In 
this role, UM has continued to excel, 
continuously producing outstanding 
leaders, intellectuals and experts. 
UM is a comprehensive 
research-focused university with 
multidisciplinary areas of research 
and teaching that encompass 
medicine, science, engineering, 
technology, social sciences and 
humanities. It has thirteen faculties, 
two academies, three centres and 
two institutes. UM also has the 
first and biggest teaching hospital 
in Malaysia, the Universiti Malaya 
Medical Centre (UMMC), which 
provides excellent healthcare 
services and serves as a major 
referral centre for Malaysia. In 
addition, the UM Research Clusters 
were established to further drive 
interdisciplinary research that 
addresses national and global 
challenges.
Steadfast in upholding our 
nation’s aspirations, UM strives 
to achieve a global presence and 
international recognition. In recent 
years, UM has emerged among 
the world’s top 100 universities 
in the Quacquarelli Symonds 
(QS) World University Rankings. 
UM continues to strengthen and 
promote strategic partnerships with 
relevant stakeholders that include 
UM at a Glance

universities, industries, and 
government. To ensure that UM’s 
academic curriculum meets and 
exceeds national and international 
requirements, all of the university’s 
academic programmes fulfill the 
standards set by the Malaysian 
Qualification Agency (MQA). The 
university has also successfully 
attained accreditations from both 
local and international bodies as 
well as various institutions and 
professional bodies. UM also 
receives regional recognition 
through institutional assessment 
by the ASEAN University Network-
Quality Assurance (AUN-QA), 
a testament to UM’s quality as 
an institution of prestige at the 
international level.
UM attributes its strength and 
success to the university’s diverse 
and inclusive staff, students, 
partners and collaborators, 
and alumni. UM’s commitment 
and contribution to academia 
and society through teaching, 
research, and services has had a 
positive impact on the nation and 
the world.

UM Strategic Plan 2021-2025
“The House of Excellence”
Our strategic framework is 
focused on building a “House 
of Excellence”. Supported by 
five strategic pillars - Income 
generation, Teaching and learning, 
Research and innovation, Talent, 
and Entrepreneurship - this 
“House of Excellence” will propel 
UM in its journey towards realizing 
its Mission and Vision over the 
next five years. 
With the implementation of these 
initiatives UM is expected to: 
achieve financial independence; 
produce graduates who are agile, 
resilient and able to adapt to an 
ever-changing world; and provide 
solutions for real world problems 
with the implementation of 
research output.
Serving the nation, Impacting 
the world. In line with the Shared 
Prosperity Vision 2030, UM 
will ensure that it continuously 
supports efforts towards the 
improvement of the quality of life. 
We will continue our partnerships 
with industry, academic 
institutions and the government 
to ensure that our outputs are in 
sync with the needs of the nation 
and the world. Excellence in execution. We 
will never compromise on our 
values and the quality of our 
work. Excellence has always 
been at the core of everything 
we do - university operations, 
teaching and learning, research, 
and services. It will continue to 
remain the driving force in all our 
future endeavours. We will excel. 
We will play a leading role in 
realising our nation’s aspirations, 
and contribute towards the 
United Nations’ Sustainability 
Development Goals  (SDGs). 
Without our stakeholders, we 
are but a ship without sails. Our 
students, staff, strategic partners 
and collaborators, the industry, 
government agencies, alumni and 
society - we will forge a lifelong 
bond with all of them, striving to 
understand their needs so that  
together, we will make the world a 
better place. 
Universiti Malaya (UM), like many 
other globally known universities, 
is facing a number of challenges. 
These include achieving financial 
stability and self-sustainability, as 
well as increasing competitiveness 
via internationalisation and 
digitalisation of higher education. 
However, UM has a long tradition 
of excellence and has been 
weathering challenges for the last 
100 years. We are not cowed by 
challenges, but instead believe 
there are always opportunities in 
the challenges we face. To meet 
these challenges, we should 
shift from supply to demand-
creation in higher education and 
be a part of wealth creation both 
nationally and beyond our shores, 
leading towards financial self-
sustainability.
Student tuition fees have the 
potential to become a relatively 
larger income source for UM 
with new entry routes and study 
modes such as Universiti Malaya’s 
Open Channel or Saluran Terbuka 
Universiti Malaya (SATU), Open 
and Distance Learning (ODL), Remote Learning (RL) and 
Microcredentials. Income flow 
generated from these sources 
will be reasonably predictable, 
enabling more effective future 
planning both in financial terms, 
and in terms of value delivered to 
UM stakeholders, especially UM 
students.
Financial self-sustainability will 
ensure UM is able to continue 
playing its roles and carrying out 
its responsibilities to society. It 
will also enable the university to 
invest in priority areas including 
other untapped opportunities in 
higher education. These include 
better facilities, conducive 
learning environment, innovative 
educational programmes, and 
initiatives to continue producing 
leaders in their respective fields.  
UM, as the leading public 
Research University in Malaysia, 
will continue its traditional role as 
the national torchbearer for higher 
education excellence on the 
global stage.Objective

Advancing values, talent and 
human capital remains the central 
pillar in empowering a resilient and 
forward-looking organisation in its 
drive to achieve strategic future 
visions and missions. Sustained, 
structured and integrated 
approaches and initiatives in 
transforming talent and human 
capital are key in developing 
an overarching organisational 
goal that is mission-led and 
future-driven, with the workforce 
forming the main foundation of its 
success. 
Central to this element is a 
dynamic learning approach where 
individuals constantly pursue 
knowledge, expertise, skills and 
experience in a sustainable and 
consistent manner. Crediting 
talent, formation of holistic talent 
assessment and appreciation, 
and human capital development 
and advancement are leading the drive towards the creation of a 
world class and knowledge-driven 
workforce.
There are three main elements in 
the systematic, integrated and 
comprehensive spectrum of talent 
development, management and 
advancement encapsulated in this 
pillar; they form the cornerstone in 
efforts to achieve the university’s 
new vision and mission. 
Each element is instrumental 
in ensuring the success of 
the university’s Strategic and 
Transformation Plan and is 
aimed at achieving the intended 
milestones of a knowledge-, 
future- and value-based human 
capital.Objective

UM has introduced 
“Entrepreneurship” in its Strategic 
Plan 2021-2025, in line with 
the aim of becoming a global 
university impacting the world. 
This move is also in line with the 
aspiration of the Ministry of Higher 
Education (MOHE) to incorporate 
entrepreneurship within the 
curriculum and produce graduates 
that are able to act as catalysts for 
economic transformation.
Successful entrepreneurs require 
certain traits that can be nurtured 
early in their lives. Universiti 
Malaya aims to create a holistic 
and conducive entrepreneurship 
ecosystem for its community, thus meeting the goals of the Shared 
Prosperity Vision (SPV) and UN’s 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs).
For this, Universiti Malaya plans 
to establish more incubators and 
accelerator units to support and 
enhance entrepreneurial activities, 
besides nurturing graduates with 
entrepreneurial mindsets that 
are resilient, forward-thinking 
and competitive. It is hoped that 
the university’s efforts will be 
enhanced with the cooperation 
of role models and successful 
entrepreneur leaders who will 
make the country proud. Objective
