SMU 2025 COMPENDIUM 3 PRESIDENT’S MESSAGEPRESIDENT’S MESSAGE
Since Vision 2025 was first unveiled in 2014, SMU has steadily grown in 
the breadth and depth of our accomplishments. We have successfully made 
meaningful impact in myriad ways on our economy and society.
From 2020, we enter the second phase of this journey, at a time when the world 
is facing new challenges and opportunities – not least those presented by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Our university must respond and refocus our resources and 
energies accordingly.
SMU 2025 is our strategic plan which provides the focused approach we need 
for the growth journey ahead. It offers a framework grounded in three priorities: 
Digital Transformation, Sustainable Living, and Growth in Asia. It is in these areas 
where our cross-disciplinary strengths intersect with the future needs of Singapore 
and the region, and where our potential for impact creation is the greatest. 
SMU 2025 offers a framework within which our faculty and staff have the 
freedom to contribute ideas and initiatives as circumstances evolve. We believe 
that having this focus, framework and freedom will enhance SMU’s unique edge 
and propel our growth in strength, standing and stature. 
I look forward to the exciting work before us, as SMU continues our collective 
journey of bringing our vision to fruition, and ultimately, of growing impact and 
cultivating change.

emerging challenges and seizing opportunities on the horizon.

Growing Impact, Cultivating Change
The SMU 2025 strategic plan will guide us in 
the next phase of reaching for Vision 2025. It 
reminds us of our aspiration, or “where to aim”.
Three priorities have been selected as focal 
areas, or “where to play”. They closely align 
with the university’s strengths and bear 
increasing relevance for the future, especially in 
the wake of recent forces of disruption.
We have developed a set of strategies that 
guide us in “how to play” within the three 
priorities, striving for transformative education, 
cutting edge research, as well as meaningful  
engagement with our city, region and world.
Finally, to realise these initiatives, we need 
a solid infrastructure of enablers to lay the 
foundations for “how to win”.
While the framework provides a clear focus, 
it also gives faculty and staff the freedom to 
contribute new ideas as we proceed on the 
path of growing impact and cultivating change.

 OUR ASPIRATIONTo be a world-renowned global city university,
tackling the world’s complexities,
impacting humanity positively.
We do so by nurturing global citizens through transformative 
education, addressing societal challenges through cutting 
edge research, and engaging with the city and world to 
make meaningful impact.VISION 2025OUR ASPIRATION (“where to aim”)
SMU 2025 COMPENDIUM 7Following discussions with multiple stakeholder 
groups, SMU has selected three priorities that serve 
as cross-disciplinary focal points, cutting across our 
various Schools and focusing our efforts on areas of 
particular economic and social relevance to our  
nation and region.
These priorities were selected because they:
• Address the future needs of Singapore, 
the regional economy and community 
• Position students well for the future 
• Draw on a wealth of faculty expertise
• Align with SMU’s unique strengths
• Provide meaningful opportunities for 
staff contributions
• Capture the interest of external stakeholders 
as potential collaborators and benefactorsOUR PRIORITIES (“where to play”)
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
We will spearhead cutting edge ideas to digitally transform the private and public 
sectors and develop robust insights into the impact of digitalisation on customer 
and citizen experience.

SUSTAINABLE LIVING
We will drive solutions in managing climate change and sustainable city living, 
enhancing quality of life and shaping legal, regulatory and financing frameworks
