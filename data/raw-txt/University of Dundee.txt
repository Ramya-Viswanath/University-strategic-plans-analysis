University of Dundee Strategy 2022–2027
Principal’s 
introduction
We are living through times of great change and uncertainty.  
As a community, we need to recognise our responsibility to face this moment, and bring all our different forms of knowledge, listening skills, creativity, and determination to help meet the challenges ahead.
Climate change, biodiversity loss, and social exclusion present  
some of the most severe risks to global stability and must be  tackled urgently, consistently and clear-headedly. At the same time, the rise of populism has undermined the value of expertise and the purpose of learning, while debate has opened up about the ‘value’  of higher education.
All this has come alongside Covid-19, and a pandemic that has 
caused an economic shock at least three times worse than the  2008 financial crisis as well as rising concerns around global security. Those already facing social and economic disadvantage have been disproportionately affected, including significant  impacts on population health, wealth and, perhaps most worryingly, hope for the future.
These issues impact us all, drawing into focus the systemic barriers 
that hold too many people back. I believe the greatest contribution we can make to tackling these global challenges and systemic inequalities is sustained action within our University, across our community, and through our worldwide networks of partners. In particular, our strong and vibrant partnership with our students, current, past and future, is essential for ensuring that the education and student experience we offer are amongst the best in the world.
We are well placed to deliver, firmly rooted in Scotland’s City of 
Design, a beacon for innovation and regeneration, belonging to a strong creative culture, and having been ranked as a top University globally for climate action.
We don’t blithely claim to attract the brightest minds, we grow  
them. None of us arrives fully realised. We are all students, we are always learning through challenges, through meaningful and respectful interactions with each other, and across boundaries  and perspectives. What unites us is that every one of us belongs  to Dundee, contributes to a shared set of values, and helps shape  our driving sense of social purpose.We are here to help each other set meaningful goals, inspire each other, and empower one another to have positive impacts. That is why our consultation process was so important to me in developing this strategy. I would like personally to thank every student, member of staff, and friend of the University who took the time to input – whether in one of our open sessions, via email, through staff and student focus groups, or engagement with DUSA and other representatives.
Together we must build on their contributions to form a strong 
partnership for change. Change will bring new opportunities, but it will also bring challenges. We must meet and overcome these challenges as a caring community and I do not take that for granted. I will make sure that through the planning and delivery of our strategy we continue to ensure time for reflection, opportunities to collectively reimagine our goals and norms, and to keep developing our intelligence.
This strategy aims to develop the University of Dundee as a place 
where we can each grow our abilities, where people come to be stretched, to contribute, and to have positive impact on the world.
To do that we need to be fiscally responsible as we look to secure 
the future of our triple intensity across Research, Education and Engagement. We need to be more permeable – open to new ideas, understanding changing needs, collaborating across boundaries, widening access to education, and fully realising the breadth of people who have a stake in what we do.
We have a huge opportunity to build on the social contract we have 
in our University and with our city to advocate for our values, and to grow our capacity to transform lives. As we succeed we will ensure we remain: of, and for, Dundee.

University of Dundee Strategy 2022–2027
DUSA President’s 
introduction
When you become a student at the University of Dundee you 
automatically become a member of the Dundee University  Students’ Association (DUSA), and you also become a stakeholder  of something far wider and far greater: the future of the University  of Dundee and the future of the broader community.
We are experiencing a milestone moment for our university, as 
we collectively attempt to ambitiously redefine our strengths, our dreams, and our presence in the post-Covid-19 era. None of us should take for granted the ability to benefit from a first-class education, and to participate in the intellectual community of a world-leading, research-intensive institution, that is consistently recognised as one of the best institutions in the nation for student experience. We should cultivate it as a gift and share it with others.
Our university is distinguished amongst so many great others for  
its student experience because at its heart lies the importance  of student engagement and its identity derives from its colourful, proud and diverse student community.
Student representation will be key to the University’s ongoing 
success, and I warmly endorse this document’s commitment and emphasis to include student representation as a key factor on all the decisions made within the institution. This is evidence of the importance of student engagement in the consultation. The feedback and insights of students have made this strategy stronger, and I look forward to seeing this partnership developing and impacting communities and individuals far beyond the borders  of our campus.This is perhaps the most exciting era to be part of the Dundee community. We now have a university strategy that aligns with DUSA’s vision of a kinder, greener, more diverse global student community. Only by working together can we create a real opportunity to build a memorable legacy over the next five years, to help ensure these themes of DUSA’s vision are part of what makes Dundee different and a leader in the sector. Social purpose is at the heart of the University’s Strategy, and this represents a call to action for all students to show what marvellous things we can do by engaging meaningfully, dynamically, and with compassion to help shape  and deliver impact in the world.
The Strategy paves the way forward, but what matters is not only  
the Strategy itself but how we can ensure its fruitful materialisation.  I know there is much to be done together in the years ahead, but  I am certain that Dundee students will bring passion, energy and precious insight to the task that will guarantee the effectiveness  of this document.
DUSA and the University will continue to work as strong partners  
to develop an institution that will provide opportunities to all students to be active members of our community to contribute meaningfully. I am confident that together we can ensure that living the Strategy is a rewarding experience, creating opportunities for students to develop skills and influence, and help ensure that DUSA and the University will continue to set the bar distinctly high for student experience.

University of Dundee Strategy 2022–2027
Our identity, purpose, 
and values
We are a university that holds social purpose, building on our 
long-standing values, dear to our hearts. We are not afraid to act purposively to make a real difference in the world. The primacy of social purpose was intrinsic in our founding principles and has evolved and grown with us as we continue to transform lives, locally and globally, working together as a community to deliver positive change. We will be “One Dundee”.
Our impact on the world around us is enabled by the intensity of 
our focus in research, education, and engagement. In the coming decades, this triple intensity will be further enhanced across our university as we ensure that we pursue excellence in all that we do to make a positive difference. The changes we make will ensure that the legacy we pass on will be strong, vibrant, and relevant to current and future challenges we all will face.

Social purpose inspires us and drives everything we do.
We deliver impact through our graduates and students, our research 
and scholarship, and our contribution to health, society, and the economy across the globe and here in Scotland. Our students are co-architects of the future and our partnership with them means that the student voice and our commitment to the student experience are, and will remain, distinctive features of the Dundee experience, the “Dundee Difference”. Together with our students, we actively nurture our relationship with wider society, both locally and globally.
We will move forward with confidence, clarity of direction, and focus 
to ensure that our high performing community continues to have a positive impact on the world around us.Vision
Our vision is to be a University globally renowned for our social purpose, delivered through our intensity and excellence in research, education and engagement. We will be agile and globally connected, focused on what we do best and where we can most effectively transform lives. Our students will be recognised as talented contributors to the work that is urgently needed to address the most pressing problems facing the world.
Mission
Building on our history and the world-changing heritage of our city, our mission continues to be to ‘transform lives though the creation, sharing, and application of knowledge’.
Values
Our core values were adopted in 2012 after a deep and reflective consultation across our extended community. They describe who  we are and how we act. 
They are:→

University of Dundee Strategy 2022–2027
The Dundee Difference
Active partnership is a distinctive aspect of our University. We are 
committed to working with our students, actively listening to them and responding to their voice. That commitment is genuine and needs constant work to ensure that it remains a mark of distinction. The partnership between staff and students, between the University and DUSA (Dundee University Students’ Association), is fundamental to who we are and to our success and needs to respond to challenges, local and global, as they arise.
This approach extends to how we work with other partners here in 
Tayside and around the world. We have a strong sense of place, as a beacon within our fast-changing city with world-leading areas of research-intensity characterised by excellence and real-world impact. We have a history of design led and creative approaches  and of educating high quality graduates providing them with the skills to become global change-makers. We benefit from our location with city centre appeal combined with the security of a vibrant campus, and the remarkable quality of the natural environment  that surrounds us.
What makes us distinctive and unique is the combination of all  
of these elements. We call this the Dundee Difference .Our future focus
We have significant areas of excellence in research, education,  and social impact which enable us to fulfil our mission in transforming lives. However, we can and will do even more to focus our contributions. We have the human, financial, and physical resources to deliver an even stronger and more vibrant university. We also have both the appetite and capacity to embrace positive change, to be fit for the future and to manage the associated risks.
Over the next five-year period, we will continue to grow and focus on 
our internationally recognised excellence in life sciences, medicine and health, and art and design. We will reinvigorate and enhance our competitive strengths in science and engineering, business, law, social sciences and humanities to meet contemporary challenges, both local and global, in addressing social problems and in meeting the needs of the employment market.
We will confront head-on the challenges and uncertainties that 
society is facing and support the delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We will develop priority academic themes  to provide focus and concentrate our impact on those areas  where we can make the most difference. 
These are:→
 P
opulation Health and Wealth
→
 Cl
imate Action and Net Zero
→
 E
quity and Inclusion
Investigating these themes in our curricula will ensure that our 
students will be active global citizens attuned to social needs  from the local to the global as well as the ways in which these are interconnected.
We will also strengthen and form new alliances and partnerships,  
at home and abroad, based on mutual respect and recognition of the need for co-design and co-delivery that meet all of our needs, particularly of those most disadvantaged.
We will be decisive in making choices and initiating changes that  
will deliver on these themes.

Ensuring our academic excellence
We will be clear in determining which disciplines we will focus on, 
drawing on the best available evidence of our performance in research, education, and engagement. These will be areas where our levels of excellence and intensity mean they are sustainable, deliver outstanding research and impact, are attractive to students and employers, ensure a strong student experience and have clear benefits for society.
We will ensure, through our planning processes, the continuous 
enhancement of our academic performance, in a focused way, underpinned by financial sustainability. In doing so we will provide  a platform for future investment and growth.
Growing our reach
We have long been committed to bringing the world to Dundee and taking Dundee to the world. In the coming five years the University will become a truly global institution. We already have a track record of international excellence, reach and impact in research. We have expanded the international character of our campuses and this is  a continuing focus as we continue to shape our relationship with  the wider world post-Brexit. Our global reach will grow with over 2,000 students studying internationally for Dundee degrees across a range of disciplines within the coming five years. We are also committed to supporting our UK students to enjoy international mobility opportunities, and, in keeping with our social purpose, to ensuring that financially challenged students can access such opportunities.

University of Dundee Strategy 2022–2027
Our Triple Intensity
Our triple intensive University brings excellence to all that we do, with 
our research, education, and engagement all carrying equivalent weight. We are intensive in ensuring that our excellent research has positive impact and inspires our teaching. Our intensity in our innovative educational practices creates world-ready students, imbued with the values of the institution that helps shape them.  Our engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, partners, alumni, and friends is equally intensive as that network of partnerships confronts the most pressing and urgent challenges facing our society and the wider world.
Together, our triple intensity enables us to deliver on our raison d’etre  
– our social purpose.Triple intensity means that: our research is pushing through the 
limits of current knowledge and thereby ensuring that our curricula are at the cutting-edge across all subjects; our students participate in research through their projects and by playing an active role in enriching our research culture; the knowledge we gain from our research has practical impact; our educational intensity equips our students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience to bring to bear in the real world. All three components of our triple intensity inform, inspire and stimulate each other.Social

with impact
Intensity and excellence are complementary aspects of everything we deliver. Intensity implies concentration and volume. Excellence predominantly means quality. It is that excellence, together with intensity, that we constantly strive to achieve in research, education and engagement.
All colleagues have a different contribution to make, and each 
School’s intensity may have its own distinctive shape. Some areas of our University will, by the nature of their discipline or their focus on professional practice, be more or less intensive in the research that they carry out or the direct engagement they have with society. However, we are committed to ensuring that our learning and teaching is always intensive and that there is a relentless focus on excellence in all our areas of our academic activity.
It is the unique formation of these strengths and principles – our 
triple intensity delivered with active attention to excellence and place – that makes the University of Dundee special and helps us  to transform lives.

University of Dundee Strategy 2022–2027
Research with impact
The bedrock of Dundee’s global reputation for impact is the 
extraordinary strength of our research.
We will be recognised as a world-leading university, and collaborative 
partner of choice, founded on the excellence and transformative impact of our research. Our global reach will be recognised, and our social purpose will also champion the delivery of prosperity, jobs  
and well-being to our local and regional communities.
We value basic, curiosity-driven research as a driver of discovery.  
We will build on these knowledge foundations to develop new ideas and theories, continuing to develop design-led innovations addressing global challenges in the fields of health, education, sustainability, and social justice.
Our enabling strategy on Research with Impact sets out the tangible 
steps we will take to foster a culture of excellence delivering world-class impact transforming lives locally and globally.
Education and student experience
We will offer a world-leading education and student experience through a blend of traditional programmes, stackable qualifications, and micro-credentials, with flexibility and support to learn on campus, through blended learning or online. Our programmes will develop skills and will support work-based learning to maximise the opportunity for students to move into the world of work.
Our learning and teaching will be student-focused, delivering the 
best possible student experience and work-ready students equipped for the world that they are destined to shape. To support their development as change-makers, our students will be encouraged to help develop and define the values of the university. Through this ongoing endeavour students will be empowered to help us create and deliver a smooth and seamless student experience from the point of initial enquiry to graduation and beyond, as alumni and continuing members of our community.
Our approach throughout development and delivery of learning  
and teaching in Dundee, Kirkcaldy, and internationally will be through meaningful and sustained partnerships. This is the commitment that underpins our enabling strategy on Education  and Student Experience.Engagement and enterprise
Dundee is an innovative university, internationally recognised for our enterprise culture and delivering collaborative outcomes that transform lives and deliver economic impact. Our strategy will develop new approaches for creating economic, civic and cultural benefits and sustain Dundee as an engine of start-up and spin-out businesses and increasingly anchor these here in our region.
Our immediate priorities are innovation in the Life Sciences, to be 
joined by eco-innovation, and the creative industries, including AI and creative computing. Our first focus will be to deliver a globally recognised Life Sciences Innovation District, cementing the reputation of Dundee as a powerhouse of biomedical innovation and broader biosciences. Dundee is also an exemplar “engaging” university. We actively learn from and work with communities and partner organisations to ensure we deliver our shared priorities in a sustainable, inclusive and socially responsible manner. Our collaborative approach will mobilise staff and students in advancing the practice of engagement. We will build on the achievement of our Gold Watermark for Public Engagement. This will include critically evaluating our impact, widely sharing our expertise, and providing structured programmes of support for regional entrepreneurs and business leaders.
Our enabling strategy on Engagement and Enterprise sets out how 
we will achieve this.

University of Dundee Strategy 2022–2027
Investing in people
Our people are the heartbeat of our University. The drive and passion 
of our staff, students, and supporters is the essential means by which we realise our full potential – both as a high performing community and as a shining beacon for our city.
Our continued success will depend on the enhancement of our 
global reputation for academic excellence and on achieving growth. We need, therefore, to nurture our people and their talents by embedding throughout the organisation an inclusive culture of empowerment and accountability. This will allow us to celebrate together our differing contributions to the excellence of the institution and to support one another to thrive.
Our priority will be to invest in our people, inspiring them to be 
innovative and to maximise the impact of their talents for the benefit of wider society. We will create and nurture a vibrant organisational culture, marked by a deep commitment to equality and a celebration of our diversity. We will invest in the capacity of our leaders to ensure they have the skills and abilities they need to inspire others in the delivery of positive transformation. This will be an inclusive, confident, high performing community in which we manage, develop and celebrate our people and their varied contributions to our social purpose. We will all be accountable to one another for delivery of our key priorities and together we will make the University of Dundee a fantastic place to work.
Our enabling strategy on People and Talent addresses tangible  
steps we will take over the next five years in the areas of:

Engagement  
and enterprise
Recognising strength
The city locates us in a network of dynamic relationships: its 
economy, its natural resources, its culture and imagination, social institutions, and knowledge networks. These networks have shaped our ethos, through its history of radical thought, passionate creativity, and commitment to social equity. We realise our possibilities in the world together. In return, we feel our responsibility to play our part in their wellbeing. Our power to advance those ecosystems through joint working has been proven.
Through collaboration with the regional National Health Service 
Board we have transformed lives by making Dundee the first city in the world to eliminate hepatitis C. Our partnership with Dundee City Council helped attract the V&A Dundee (Scotland’s Design Museum), and supported the city’s achievement of UNESCO City of Design status. The University’s reputation was key to attracting the Eden Project to Dundee, with plans to open a world-leading centre  of education, ecology and inclusive community practices driving urban regeneration.
The strength of these relationships has not gone unnoticed. Our 
commitment to translational research through industry partnerships has earned us recognition as one of Europe’s most innovative universities. Our enterprise culture, drawing from innovative research and education, is strongly geared to creating prosperity and wellbeing, and leads to consistent recognition as one of the top universities for our success in the creation of spin-out companies. We are also the first university in Scotland to win an institutional Gold Watermark from the UK National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement. Meanwhile our enterprise culture, geared at creating prosperity and wellbeing, has seen us ranked 5th in the UK and first in Scotland for the successful creation of spin out companies.
Strategic vision
Our immediate priorities are innovation in the Life Sciences, to be joined by eco-innovation (including Net Zero), and the creative industries, including AI and creative computing. Our first focus will be to deliver a globally recognised Life Sciences Innovation District, cementing the reputation of Dundee as a powerhouse of biomedical innovation and boarder biosciences.
We will listen and learn so we co-create economic, civic and cultural 
benefits in a sustainable, inclusive, and socially responsible manner.
We will sustain Dundee as a globally recognised engine of start-up 
and spin-out businesses, developing our ability to grow and retain companies and wealth-creation in the region.
Our One Dundee approach will mobilise staff and students in 
engagement, widely sharing our expertise where sought.Supporting excellence

We will deliver digital and campus experiences, blended seamlessly 
through the development of a Digitally Enabled Campus.
Our digital infrastructure will support and enable world-class 
research, research-led teaching, and engagement activity, delivering and enhancing services people want to use rather than have to use.
