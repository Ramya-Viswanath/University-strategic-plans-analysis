4  Strategic plan - Université Grenoble Alpes
Rising to the challenges of the 21st century, togetherUniversité Grenoble Alpes (UGA) is the result of a bringing together  of the minds of the stakeholders in higher education and research in Grenoble and Valence. The University stays true to its mandates, and is committed to meeting the scientific, social and environmental challenges of the 21st century. Its impact is felt on a daily basis through the actions of its 59,000 students, 4,500 lecturers, teacher-researchers and researchers, as well as through the 3,200 members of its administrative and technical staff.UGA is committed to the success of its students and to ensuring that its staff members are able to carry out their duties in an optimum work environment. To this end, the University relies on the knowledge it generates and shares with the community to act for the development of the region, the social openness of the university, and the promotion of diversity and non-discrimination - placing particular emphasis on gender equality.Working in close collaboration with its national research partners and drawing on the presence of the considerable scientific resources in its area, the University has developed its research and innovation policy on an international scale.It pushes the boundaries of knowledge by providing support to its disciplines and encouraging cooperation and dialogue between them to build the interdisciplinarity required to tackle the socio-economic and cultural issues we face today, and further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.UGA’s strategic plan is more than just a roadmap for bringing a 4-year ambition to fruition - it highlights the importance and richness of the commitment of all of its stakeholders. This strategic plan is the result of the work and collaboration of all of the UGA’s departments and bodies.It lays out five strategic goals that are an integral part to structuring our future common initiatives and actions are structured. I would like to thank everyone who was involved in this stage of production and who, despite the difficult circumstances created by the public health crisis, have enabled us to build the strategic plan. I would also like to thank all the members of university bodies who have helped us throughout this endeavour by providing constructive criticism and advice.My aim is that all of the UGA’s stakeholders will incorporate this strategic plan into their work and in their ambitions.  It is only by walking this path together that we will ensure the success of this new university model, which distinguished itself as unique by its diversity, social and environmental responsibility, openness and ambition!PresidentYassine Lakhnech

Strategic plan - Université Grenoble Alpes  5The context and methodology  Université Grenoble Alpes : As of 1 January 2020, the new Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA) brought together the «grandes écoles» of the Grenoble INP Institute of Engineering and Management, Sciences Po Grenoble and the Grenoble School of Architecture, with the 21 teaching departments of the former Université Grenoble Alpes and its six research centres.The national research bodies the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (Inria) and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) are now even more closely associated with the new Université Grenoble Alpes to develop a common policy for research and development on an international scale. Relationswith the French National Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE), the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) and the Grenoble Alpes University Hospital (CHU) have also been strengthened in context and new architecture of the new university.Defining our approach  to UGA’s Strategic PlanUGA’s 2021-2024 strategic plan was created in collaboration with stakeholders in education and research, and local cultural and socio-economic partners, with the approval of the university’s different bodies. The strategic plan was developedas a result of two main stages. The first, running from March to July 2020, focused on the university’s mission, our new university’s 10-year ambition, and the strategic goals setting out our main drivers for the next four years.From September to February 2021, a wider consultation enabled reflection on our priorities, the areas to be supported in the next four years, and the values promoted by the university.
