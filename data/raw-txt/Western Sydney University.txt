Sustaining Success 2021-2026 [https://westernsydney.edu.au/sustainingsuccessplan] presents the mission, values, principles and enablers of Western Sydney University and
provides a strategic roadmap for the next six years. It makes clear our mission and the values that underpin the business of the University, reinforcing that we are a values-
based and ethical organisation.
Our strategic plan defines the future direction and priorities for the University. It commits us to a shared mission and values fundamental to the University and region while
rethinking the role and position of the University locally, nationally and globally.
Mission
Starting in Western Sydney, our students will succeed, our research will have impact and our communities will thrive through our commitment to excellence, sustainability,
equity, transformation and connectedness.
Values
Our values define who we are and what we expect and encourage in each other. They are lived and embedded in the behaviours of everyone within the University
community. Our values represent a commitment to our students, people and communities, both local and global.Our values are: Boldness, Fairness, Integrity, Excellence.
Principles
The University is accountable to its values. We will be guided by them in recovery and renewal. They inform, and are realised through adherence to, our four principles:
Sustainability, Equity, Transformation and Connectedness.
Enablers
The University’s enablers set out the elements required to unlock and make possible the strategic imperatives embodied in Sustaining Success 2021–2026. They encapsulate
our values and help to guide recovery and renewal for the University and the communities within which we are embedded. Our enablers are: People, Place, Learning and
