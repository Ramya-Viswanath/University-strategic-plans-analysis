4Introduction
The Texas A&M University-Kingsville new strategic plan was drafted 
with a relatively new president (in his second year at Kingsville) and 
a new provost (in his first year at Kingsville).  It was drafted during 
the pandemic. We seized the opportunity to look at the institution 
with fresh eyes to leverage the most from the institution’s history 
and potential and then to plot a course for renewed growth.
Our 2022-2027 Strategic Plan focuses on increasing student 
success. Every student who walks in our front door should not 
leave without a diploma or certificate in his or her hand.  We have 
added a mission mantra:  student success.  This mantra is short 
enough for everyone to memorize and use as the underlying 
reason for every action. This strategic plan was carefully created by 
cross-sections of the university community through multiple focus 
group meetings with faculty, staff, students, alumni and the Texas 
A&M University-Kingsville Foundation Board. 
The format of the plan is traditional.  We list eight aspirational 
goals.  We will assess whether we achieve these goals by the 21 
measurable objectives that underpin the goals.  Additionally, in the 
appendix, we list over one hundred possible strategies that may 
be used to meet the 21 measurable objectives. The information in 
parenthesis includes links to the Texas A&M System Strategic Plan.  
We are grateful to all that contributed to the focus groups, to 
the committee meetings, to the writing and editing and lengthy 
discussions. We feel this plan will lead the institution forward and 
be true to our students and the community of South Texas.  
This plan is effective August 2021 upon approval by the Texas A&M 
University System Board of Regents. 

5Overarching Goals and Measureable Objectives 
1Assure that all students are successful 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 1, 5
Achieve a first-year retention rate of 85% or more 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 1, 5 • Accountability 2.6, 3.8
Achieve undergraduate graduation rates of 4-year 45% and 6-year 70% or more 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 5 • Accountability 2.6, 2.7 & 3.8
Reduce the Dropped, Failed, or Withdrawal (DFW) rate for undergraduates 
to 10% or less 
Core Principle: Impact • Accountability 2.6, 3.8, 3.9, & 3.12
90% of students seeking employment have a job related to their discipline of 
study within 6 months 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision 5 • Accountability 3.10
90% of students seeking entrance to graduate school or professional school 
will be successful 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision 5 • Accountability 3.10A university education is important for many reasons, including long-term financial gain, job stability, career 
satisfaction, and success outside of the workplace. Texas A&M University-Kingsville as both a Hispanic- and 
minority-serving institution has a moral obligation to make certain that our students are successful. With more 
occupations requiring advanced education, a college degree is critical to success in today’s workforce.
 
College graduates earn more on average. Workers with a college degree are less likely to face unemployment 
and are more likely to experience job satisfaction. Thus, a university education can change the life of our 
students and have a positive impact on their families, too. A student who is successful with their college 
education also experiences other benefits in life. College degree holders are more likely to be homeowners, 
have higher incomes, and live longer lives with better health. 
Every student who attends Texas A&M University-Kingsville is entitled to be successful. We must do 
everything possible to make certain that they are successful.GOAL 1

OBJECTIVE 5
62Provide a residential campus experience that enriches our students 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 1GOAL 2
A residential campus offers our students strong support networks in an environment where it is easy to 
make friends. They are in a safe environment and are surrounded by other students who also must devote a 
significant amount of time to academic work. Thus, it is easier for residential students to succeed.
The social fabric of South Texas is evident on the campus of Texas A&M University-Kingsville. The partnership 
with the historic King Ranch, the preservation of South Texas heritage reflected in the John E. Conner 
Museum and Archives, and the close-knit working relationship with the Kingsville community help students to 
understand their environment and their heritage.
 
Students can benefit academically, socially, and personally with a strong residential campus experience. 
Provide students with weekly and varied social activities 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 1 & 3 • Accountability 3.8
At least once a semester, hold a student social event with faculty and staff 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision 5 • Accountability 3.8
At least once a year, hold a student social event with families and faculty 
and staff 
Core Principle: Access and Affordability • Vision 5 • Accountability 3.8

Recognized top-Quality Academic Programs 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 5 • Accountability 3.12GOAL 3
GOAL 4Texas A&M University-Kingsville has an obvious stake in building strong relationships with the community 
that surrounds our campus. We do not have the option of relocating and thus are, of necessity, a place-based 
anchor. While corporations, businesses, and residents often flee from economically depressed, low-income 
urban and suburban edge-city neighborhoods, as a university, we will remain a steadfast institution in our 
community. At a time when foundations that help establish community-based projects are often unable to 
continue with ongoing, long-term involvement in communities, as a university, we can play an important role. 
Universities are inherently an important potential institutional base for helping community-based economic 
development and civically engaged development.
 
Students benefit from being a part of an established institution. They can contribute to service learning in an 
environment where they feel ownership and can observe the cultural ties within the greater community.
For many years, judgments about “quality” in higher education were determined almost solely by institutional 
reputation, productivity, and factors such as fiscal, physical, and human resources. Regional accreditors, 
charged with examining the adequacy of public and independent institutions, looked mostly at the overall level 
of institutional resources and at internal shared-governance processes. 
Over the past decades, however, interest on the part of students and their parents in the actual academic 
performance of colleges and universities has steadily risen. Pass rates, graduation rates, career opportunities 
and social mobility are closely tied to academic quality.
With the effective decreases in public funding for a college education and the increased cost to the student 
and the family, it makes economic sense for students and their families to invest in the best academic program 
available. Texas A&M Kingsville will initiate or participate in one new annual event that builds 
community ties each year 
Core Principle: Excellence • Vision: 1 & 3 • Accountability 5.19
Review and revise undergraduate academic programs with respect to number of 
majors, job opportunities for graduates and program interest resulting in revision of 
at least 10% of undergraduate degree programs 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 1, 3 • Accountability 3.10OBJECTIVE 10
OBJECTIVE 11
85Provide our students an innovative education 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 1, 3 • Accountability 3.8, 3.10GOAL 5
Using innovative methods of teaching is a crucial skill for all instructors. Scientific research has shown 
that innovative teaching methods and approaches can significantly enhance the student learning process. 
Developing innovative teaching strategies is challenging. It often places instructors firmly outside of their 
comfort zones and into in a position where failure is possible. However, experimenting with new instructional 
methods and strategies can improve student engagement, motivation and attainment and is a win-win for both 
students and instructors.
Instructors create the mood and tone of the room. Positive classroom cultures that invite authentic learning can 
lead to more opportunities for students to positively connect with content, their peers, and their instructor.Enhance the quality of the undergraduate programs to increase undergraduate 
enrollment by 20% 
Core Principle: Excellence • Vision: 3, 5 • Accountability 3.10
All full-time students will have at least one experiential education course each year 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 1, 3 • Accountability 3.8, 3.10
25% of all undergrad courses will be offered with an engaged hybrid mode of 
teaching 
Core Principle: Access and Affordability • Value: 1, 2 • Accountability 2.6, 3.8.

online programs 
Core Principle: Access and Affordability • Vision: 1, 5 • Accountability 3.8, 3.10
Cross-disciplinary high-impact professional learning practice will be used in at least 
25% of courses offered

OBJECTIVE 17OBJECTIVE 13
96Promote innovative research, scholarship, and arts-based performances 
Core Principle: Excellence • Vision: 1, 3 • Accountability 4.14, 4.16GOAL 6
It has become almost universally accepted that our universities must adapt to the world and environment 
in which they exist. Whether it is government policy on state support, tuition and fees, the expectations of 
Generation Z, international competition, or the opportunity offered by new technologies, universities find 
themselves beset by a barrage of external change to which they must respond and adapt.
Of course, universities have always adapted, learned, and moved on – that is the basis of academic inquiry 
and the heart of the sector’s strength. Across higher education, universities are offering new courses, 
attracting new students, and are innovating in how they work. Yet, the stakes are higher than ever before. 
Universities compete for students, compete for staff, and compete for research funding.
The competitive dynamic is here to stay. Additionally, the global market for higher education is now simply too 
big and too mobile to be anything other than highly competitive. At their best, universities are innovators, risk-
takers, and pioneers, and it is these characteristics that should guide Texas A&M-Kingsville forward. 
The University must in lead in innovation in research, scholarship and also in arts-based performances to 
keep us competitive. 
Increase external research/scholarship/arts-based performance funding by 40% 
Vision: 4 • Accountability 4.13, 4.15
Programs that promote health and wellness will be accessed by more than 
40% of students 
Vision: 3OBJECTIVE 18
OBJECTIVE 197Maintain an environment that promotes the health and wellness of everyone 
Core Principle: Impact • Vision: 3GOAL 7
Texas A&M University-Kingsville is committed to enhancing the health, productivity, and quality of life of our 
community through the design and maintenance of the built environment and the development of well-being 
programs. Numerous health initiatives reflect the growing recognition that creating healthy campuses positively 
affects recruitment, retention, and student satisfaction, and they can provide the foundation for a life well-lived. 
Additionally, the concept of a “duty of care” has come to encompass a greater number of foreseeable risks that our 
campus has an opportunity and responsibility to mitigate.
108A directed effort in improving the campus physical environment will be made 
Vision: 6 • Accountability 6.23GOAL 8
The design and organization of the university campus plays a crucial role in the practical, emotional, and 
intellectual life of students, staff and faculty. We strive to have an environment that impacts daily activities 
in ways that promote knowledge and creativity. To meet modern needs, we must renovate buildings in to 
facilitate improvements. As much as possible we must limit the rigid placement of furniture such as desks 
and cabinets that inhibit social interaction. We also need to avoid offices that serve more as spaces for 
administrative tasks than as space for creative activities.
Bring one major building each year up to 21st century university standards
