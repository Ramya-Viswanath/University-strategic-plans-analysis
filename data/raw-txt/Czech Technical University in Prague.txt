Foreword from 
the CTU Rector
The Strategic Plan CTU 2021+  is a fundamental document setting out development 
priorities of the university’s education policy through 2030. It describes university-
wide activities planned in coordination with f aculties, higher-education organizations 
and other CTU components in order to meet the plan’s targets, and it also presents 
targeted measures that need to be implemented by speci ﬁ c units with regard to their 
respective mission and pro ﬁ le. The Strategic Plan draws on the de ﬁ nition and detailed 
description of the process of reinfor cing the strengths and minimizing the weaknesses 
of the university. This document may be updated in line with the progress of its 
implementation, whereby a major revision may be required in the event of a signi ﬁ cant 
change in the external environment. The outcomes of our ongoing evaluation may also 
provide an impetus for revising the document.
The signi ﬁ cance of this document is highlighted by the fact that it will create brand 
new opportunities for CTU’s development. Its drafting and completion were a ff ected 
by the Covid-19 pandemic, which unambiguously demonstrated CTU’s preparedness 
to take action when, in cooperation with businesses, it designed literally overnight 
working models of protective masks and shields. The CoroVent lung ventilator, 
developed by a professional team of Pr ofessor Karel Roubík from the Faculty of 
Biomedical Engineering of Czech Technical University in cooperation with the 
COVID19CZ initiative and other experts, is of global importance. The pandemic helped 
accelerate change and progress at all universities and signi ﬁ cantly in ﬂ uenced the 
additional internationalization of the education process. The need to rapidly respond 
to an unexpected situation also showed the merit of ﬂ exibility and agility in decision-
making by CTU bodies on the basis of analytical data and empirical research. I believe 
that the necessary and often unbidden adaptation to new conditions will in the future 
bring us e ff ective possibilities for combining contact and distance learning through 
use of multiple communication methods and tools that are available to us. I believe that technologies will enable CTU to maintain excellence in education, science and 
innovation and thus contribute to bettering the quality of society. If we succeed in 
continuing to observe the motto ‘peace and unity is strength’, together we will emerge 
from each crisis stronger.
CTU’s eight faculties and six higher-education organizations cover a broad range 
of educational, research and other creative ﬁ elds, representing a typical university 
with a balanced mix of engineering, natural sciences, arts, medical and economic 
learning. Despite the unfavourable demographic trend in recent years, demand for 
studying at specialized CTU faculties has been unwavering. The key prerequisite 
for successful development of the university is primarily professionally competent 
academicians and internationally recognized experts in scienti ﬁ c ﬁ elds, applied 
research and development disciplines and in other creative activities, including 
liberal arts disciplines. Good human resources practice, motivational programmes 
and collaboration with graduates in accordance with the HR Award principles will be 
indispensable for the university’s journey toward academic excellence. The knowledge 
gained during teaching, scienti ﬁ c work and creative activities, combined with students’ 
engagement in practice, will lead to a continuous improvement of the quality of studies 
and the performance of our graduates. The preparation of new study programmes will

provide an opportunity to link several faculties of the university and to enhance inter-
faculty cooperation. CTU, as an open and societally bene ﬁ cial university, will consistently 
participate in the lifelong learning of our citizens on an increasing scale and in keeping 
with technological development and societal demand.
We view openness to international cooperation in the broadest sense as a matter of 
course and, personally, I consider it essential to open up to partner universities, research 
institutes and other universities both abroad and in the Czech Republic. Such openness 
is motivated by expectations of a qualitative enrichment of all partners involved in 
collaboration. I perceive this approach as the only way to better the quality and prestige 
of doctoral study programmes and habilitation and professorship appointment 
procedures. The internationalization of the univ ersity and fostering of relations with 
internationally recognized education and scienti ﬁ c organizations will also enhance our 
competitiveness on a transnational scale. The participation of our students, doctoral 
candidates and researchers in international con ferences, research projects, along with 
their related study trips and other activities, will ultimately make us more competitive 
and, in tandem with organizing our own scienti ﬁ c conferences, seminars or thematic 
summer schools and courses, will help increase interest from gifted domestic and 
foreign applicants to enrol at CTU and will bring top scientists and educators to teach 
a modern generation of professionals. 
In recent years, CTU has built state-of-the-art laboratories and unique specialized 
workplaces, which have helped to rank us as a competitive and open organization on 
an international scale in a variety of r esearch areas. An undisputed prerequisite for 
excellent science will also be sharing of research infrastructure, its further expansion 
and modernization, including well-equipped ancillary facilities. It is critical to focus on 
science and innovation excellence in addressing global challenges, in particular in the 
ﬁ elds of digitization, arti ﬁ cial intelligence, robotics, cybernetics, quantum technology, 
nanotechnology, defence technologies, space , aerospace and automotive industries, 
and in other areas in line with dynamically changing societal demands. Talented young 
men and women with postgraduate degrees from CTU and other reputed universities, 
in collaboration with foreign scientists, will be a necessary condition for achieving the 
goals set by our university. Support for publishing in reputable professional journals 
and setting up a transparent and simple technology transfer operation will also be of paramount importance.
To recruit and retain quality human resources, we must establish a new Merit-based 
Career System and Conditions of Employment that will strengthen employees’ 
security and de ﬁ ne transparent rules for their pr ofessional growth. Administrative 
processes will need to be gradually streamlined by promoting digitization of our 
operations.
Commercial funding, combined with internal, na tional, European and other sources, 
help stabilize ﬁ nancing of our research. Together with an e ff ective management 
system, they provide the necessary ﬂ exibility and the ability to rapidly respond to the 
needs of society and implement new solutions into practice. The rapid development 
that we have recently seen in this regard is evidenced by the emergence of several 
successful spin-o ff  companies and production licencing. These revenues and close 
ties with industrial partners facilitate and will sustain our ability to continuously 
ﬁ nance our development in terms of both material and human resources. E ff ective 
and transparent use of all those resources and extensive engagement of commercial 
entities will result in increased ﬁ nancial self-su ffi  ciency of the university in the future. In 
addition, such funding will help maintain one of the university’s important social roles, 
notably its active engagement in the public sphere with the aim of promoting and 
popularizing science, research and innovation in the broadest sense, in an educative 
and comprehensible way, for children, primary and secondary school students and 
the general public.
For the coming decade, CTU has all prerequisites for maintaining and signi ﬁ cantly 
improving its reputation as a respected public university at home and abroad. We all 
need to make the most of that most valuable potential of the very essence of the 
university; our people – colleagues, students, educators and other representatives of 
academia, and other sta ff .

Acknowledgments
The Strategic Plan , comprising the intentions, as well as the steps 
to meet the set targets, is a document of a great university-wide 
importance. I would like to thank all of my colleagues in CTU 
management for their e ff orts and for the very ardent cooperation 
of members of all faculties, university organizations and other 
CTU components. I also want to extend my thank you to the 
members of the CTU Academic Senate and to the students who 
jointly and very actively participated in drafting the ﬁ nal version 
of this strategy.
The Strategic Plan CTU 2021+ will accompany us in the long 
term through 2030 and is, therefore, a key supporting document 
for the future development of the university. We are entering the next period at a very di ffi  cult time, our actions are largely 
influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic, where academia has 
clearly demonstrated its importance and contribution. I believe 
that the stated goals and measures will lead to the strengthening 
of CTU’s position, that we will continue to actively participate in 
major societal decisions: what is our path, which areas to treat as 
priorities, what activities to discar d and where to focus on new 
opportunities.
I assume that in the coming period we will have enough vigour 
and resources to support top science and research, scientists and 
their teams. I also expect that we will be able to strive for the 
development of the university as a whole to continue to attract 
quali ﬁ ed students who will work in scienti ﬁ c ﬁ elds or will ﬁ nd jobs 
in practical applications and will stay connected to CTU for the rest 
of their professional lives. I believe that we will succeed in making 
eff ective use of all available sources of funding to ensure further 
upgrades of infrastructure and laboratories, the development of 
centres of excellence, and improvement of testing laboratories 
to foster the university’s key strengths and utilize its intellectual 
property and historical tradition, which is of unquestionable value 
today.Thank you to all those who, with their work, talent, faith and love 
for science and education, want to participate in the development 
of CTU by ful ﬁ lling the mission de ﬁ ned within this Strategic Plan 
CTU 2021+.
