South East Technological 
University (SETU) is a university 
with a mission to deliver for 
the south east of Ireland. 
This means providing the 
highest quality teaching on 
programmes that meet the 
needs of the industry and 
society of the region. It also 
means performing research that 
creates new opportunities for 
the region while engaged with 
the challenges faced by the 
south east. We know that these 
challenges are not unique – our 
shared humanity on one planet 
Earth means there is a great 
degree of commonality and, 
while SETU places emphasis 
on its region, it takes a global 
perspective, and will bring its 
own capabilities to making 
the south east a thriving, 
sustainable, and outward-
looking region.To achieve its goals, SETU 
will need to undergo 
a transformation of its 
organisational structures 
and academic and research 
cultures. It will need to revise 
and reorient its curriculum, 
transform its operations and 
mobilise its community in 
support of its priorities.
The Governing Body thanks all 
who have worked to produce 
this plan, and we endorse this 
strategy as the best way to 
achieve the ambitions of SETU. 
We will provide the governance 
and oversight that supports the 
President and her team, and all 
the staff of SETU, to achieve 
this plan over the next five 
years.
Professor Patrick Prendergast
Chairperson of the Governing 
Body and Chancellor PREFACE
STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNING BODY

SOUTH EAST TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY

This first strategic plan for 
SETU describes our ambitious 
roadmap for the next five 
years. Our plan, “Connecting 
for Impact”, is a reflection 
of rich connectivity across 
our campus communities; 
connections forged throughout 
the south east region to drive 
economic, social and cultural 
impact; the connections that 
bind our university to the global 
community; and the essential 
connections with our learners 
who study to realise their 
ambitions.
In the coming years, SETU 
will develop new courses, 
expand PhD provision and 
offer dynamic and innovative 
curricula. We will foster a 
supportive and inclusive 
environment for our students 
and ensure equity of access 
to educational opportunity. 
Through our curricula and 
research, we will generate new 
knowledge and approaches 
to navigate a digital hyper-
connected world and the varied 
challenges of the twenty-first 
century. Our infrastructure and 
operations will be those of a 
modern, responsible university 
and will take a leadership role in 
driving towards net zero carbon 
targets.I am very excited about SETU’s 
role in creating a UNESCO 
Learning Region, developing an 
Innovation Region—including 
our leadership in the new 
University-Enterprise Quarter—
and our pivotal role in the new 
South East Challenges Initiative. 
SETU will be a galvanising force 
for the South East.
As SETU’s first President, 
it has been my pleasure to 
meet many staff and students 
in recent months and those 
interactions have helped to 
shape this plan. Many excellent 
ideas have come forward and 
I am heartened by the strong 
commitment of our staff to 
ensuring SETU’s future success. 
I would like to thank the 
Governing Body for their 
support in the development of 
this inaugural Strategic Plan for 
SETU. I look forward to working 
with colleagues across the 
university, our stakeholders and 
the Governing Body as we bring 
this Plan to successful fruition.

CONNECTING FOR IMPACT | Strategic Plan 2023-2028
ORGANISATIONAL CONTEXT 
SETU was established in 
May 2022, enabled by new 
legislation and the merger 
of two former Institutes of 
Technology that had been 
central to economic, social 
and cultural life in the south 
east for fifty years. The 
ambition of SETU is to position 
itself amongst the leading 
universities in Ireland and a 
credible driver of a reimagined 
south east centred on 
innovation and impact. 
This strategic plan sets out 
the framework within which 
the elevation in performance 
of the new University, and 
the requisite transformation 
required to facilitate that 
elevated performance, will take 
place. This transformation will 
include considerable investment 
and capacity building, capital 
expansion and the development 
of, amongst other features, 
a new University-Enterprise 
Quarter as a focal point for SETU’s role in driving regional 
innovation activity. The 
significant investment needed 
to enable the transformation 
of the organisation, as well as 
to address historical under-
investment, is detailed in the 
Plan that follows. The Plan will 
see the University conclude 
the programme of work, 
ongoing since before university 
designation, to create a single, 
unified organization with 
unified systems, structures, 
and processes in place 
across all campuses bringing 
greater coherence, focus and 
operational robustness to the 
University and positioning the 
University better to realise its 
ambitions. 
SETU’s high ambitions align 
with national policy relating to 
universities broadly and to the 
development of the region as 
summarised in the following 
paragraphs. 1 CONTEXT
The creation of SETU comes at a time of change and opportunity for 
Europe, Ireland and the south east region. The University is a vital 
instrument for communities and business in the region to respond to 
and meet present challenges and realise future opportunities. 
12
SOUTH EAST TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY
SETU AND HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY 
For SETU, Technological 
University designation carries 
with it the expectation 
that the new university will 
embrace the key elements 
of the full university  mission 
and therefore will function 
in a manner distinctive from 
the antecedent Institutes of 
Technology, while building on 
the achievements and strengths 
of those organizations. SETU, 
in common with universities 
the world over, will present 
an independent, informed 
and critical perspective  
on society and will be an 
honest broker in planning 
for a sustainable future. 
SETU will be characterised 
by the pursuit of excellence 
in teaching, research, and 
innovation activities  and will 
cultivate the curiosity-driven thinking that is necessary for 
social transformation—key 
elements in the make-up of all 
universities. As a university, and 
a lead organisation in society, 
SETU aims to be a “lighthouse” 
for diversity and equality 
of opportunity and will play 
a strong role in  facilitating 
social mobility . University 
management and governance 
will reflect the breadth of the 
university community, with 
expectations that university 
governance and decision-
making involves all stakeholders 
in the organisation, including 
learners. All these features 
of SETU align with multiple 
facets of Irish and European 
higher education policy and 
represent an enhancement on 
the performance of the legacy 
institutions.
In the light of national and European higher education policy, 
SETU, as the only university in the south east, will: 
• Enhance its socio-economic impact , surpassing the legacy institutions in impact on 
addressing the skills, education and research needs of the economy at regional level;
•	Significantly	 add to its research infrastructure and performance , developing 
research-informed graduates, in order to become the centre of knowledge creation in the 
region; 
•	Further	 develop its innovation capacity  founded on a deep culture of innovation across 
the university;
•	Further	 diversify its population  of students and staff, and take a determined, systematic 
approach to addressing inequality, especially in relation to access to education;
• Empower its community  as independent, informed thinkers with a critical role to play in 
protecting and projecting democratic values;
• Reorganise its resources  to ensure efficiency and value for money and develop 
additional revenue streams to support enhanced functions  
13
CONNECTING FOR IMPACT | Strategic Plan 2023-2028
THE REGIONAL CONTEXT FOR SETU
SETU’s ambition is to elevate 
the profile of the south east 
region by driving innovation  
that will lead to employment 
and economic activity and 
through the formation of a 
skilled, flexible and capable 
workforce , consistent with 
Impact 2030: Ireland’s Research 
and Innovation Strategy. The 
National Planning Framework 
highlights that the south east 
region has capacity for growth, 
with potential for enhanced 
economic and social innovation 
and development; that SETU 
is the only university in the 
south east  places additional 
responsibility on our new 
university to realise that 
potential. SETU’s ambition 
is to have the scale, reach 
and impact to facilitate 
and stimulate the regional 
transformations  described 
in regional and national 
development plans. 
Ireland’s National Planning 
Framework indicates population 
growth in the south east 
of between 13% and 18% 
in the coming decade with 
consequent impact on the likely 
demand for higher education—
with SETU expected to deliver 
the broad range of programmes 
and educational opportunities 
to meet that demand. The 
parallel economic elevation of the region is described in the 
Regional Spatial and Economic 
Strategy (RSES) where there 
is an emphasis on innovation 
and diversification  in the 
economy. The large number of 
SMEs in the regional economy 
is recognised by regional 
development policy as requiring 
particular kinds of development 
support; it is in this light that 
the emphasis on clustering, 
smart specialisation and the 
building of critical mass in 
key industries  is a key theme 
in the RSES and in other policy 
documents. The following areas 
of emphasis are proposed: 
• agriculture (including agri-
tech, food, sustainable 
agriculture), forestry;
• bio-pharma, life-science 
based industry;
• specialised engineering, 
advanced manufacturing;
• marine (ports, fisheries and 
the wider blue economy 
potential);
• renewable energy, the 
circular economy;
• ICT, digital technology, and 
fin-tech; 
• tourism, heritage, arts and 
culture, design and craft 
industries;
• global business services 
and financial services.
14
SOUTH EAST TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY
SETU’s ambition is to enhance 
significantly the capacity and 
capability of the existing regional 
innovation ecosystem , including 
contributing to opportunities 
associated with the transition to 
carbon neutrality and digitalisation, 
and on cultivating and developing 
regional entrepreneurship , aligning 
its effort with regional priorities. It 
is noteworthy that SETU’s extant 
research strengths and emerging 
areas strongly connect with regional 
smart specialisations and there is 
an opportunity to enhance existing 
activity in these domains as well as 
to bring new perspectives to bear 
(including through inter- and multi-
disciplinary lenses) in support of 
regional innovation. 
SETU will enhance the availability 
of a skilled, flexible, well-educated 
workforce for the economy and will 
be at the heart of a UNESCO Learning 
Region in the south east. Central 
to the development of the region’s workforce and to sustaining the 
region’s communities is the strong 
role that SETU will play in arresting 
the outward migration of people  
from the region, especially of young 
people in pursuit of higher education. 
The Learning Region proposed for 
the south east offers not only to 
increase the regional skills base but to 
promote equal access to educational 
opportunity  for everyone living 
in the region. SETU has a strong 
ethos of educational opportunity 
and significant expertise in lifelong 
learning in support of disadvantaged 
and under-represented groups, 
jobseekers, older workers, and 
economically inactive populations. 
The south east lags behind many 
other parts of the country when it 
comes to educational attainment ; 
working with partners in the context 
of the Learning Region, SETU will seek 
to address this lag through creating 
an open, inclusive, comprehensive 
university with strong entry and 
progression pathways. 
15
CONNECTING FOR IMPACT | Strategic Plan 2023-2028
SETU, the only university in the south east, will have a pivotal role in 
elevating the region and will:
• Expand  its activities
– To take account of regional population growth;
– To facilitate increased educational access and, consequently, employment opportunity; 
– To contribute to inward migration to the region and the retention of population within the 
region;
– To facilitate the benefits that accrue from a global perspective. 
• Renew its curriculum  to take greater account of regional needs and in the light of future 
skills needs, including 
– Developing a research-informed curriculum across all of its campuses;
– Further developing its apprenticeship programmes;
– Targeting recruitment in key areas of regional need.
• Transform its approach  to student entrepreneurship, increasing the number of students with 
start-up ideas and experience.
• Greatly enhance innovation and research activity in key domains in support of the 
economic proposition with:
– Transformational elevation of capacity and capability in existing areas through targeted and 
significant investment, including its leadership in the University-Enterprise Quarter;
– Developing capacity in new domains aligned to regional need, including development of 
high performing multi-disciplinary centres of excellence;
– Expanding its support for entrepreneurship and new businesses, and especially 
connecting together SETU students and faculty with entrepreneurs, agencies, 
industry partners and investor networks;
– Elevating performance towards national and global leadership in disciplines 
across the university.
• Act as a facilitator of cross-regional alignment  between the multiple 
actors engaged in regional development activity, to enhance economic, 
cultural and social development 
– Drawing on university expertise to produce reliable, robust, trustworthy 
regional intelligence that can aid region-wide decision-making and 
planning; 
– Actively promoting and caring for regional heritage and culture as a 
regional custodian.SOUTH EAST TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY

SETU AND SUSTAINABILITY 
The disruptive nature of 
rapid technological change 
and climate change create 
unprecedented challenges for 
society but also significant 
opportunities.  SETU, as a lead 
organisation within society, and 
consistent with the obligations 
created by the Paris Agreement, 
will mobilise its resources 
and expertise into the service 
of sustainability , to facilitate 
the just green transition to 
new ways of living as well as 
to identifying and realising the 
opportunities that transition 
brings. SETU will support 
managed and sustainable 
digitization —in developing 
new technologies, in enhancing 
our understanding of the social, 
cultural and environmental 
impact of new technologies 
for better and worse, and in developing digital literacy and 
skills across society. SETU 
will lead by example in the 
digitization of its own practices 
and procedures, and more 
generally in driving sustainable 
practices and being public 
advocates for sustainability . 
Addressing key social 
challenges involves drawing 
on the greatest breadth of 
expertise possible. Without 
losing or compromising the 
depth and quality of disciplinary 
knowledge, SETU will work 
across, as well as within 
disciplines , especially in the 
light of the green and digital 
transitions, in recognition that 
society’s grand challenges 
cannot be solved within one 
paradigm or field. 
With regard to sustainability, SETU will:
• Reshape its curriculum, research effort, and operational practices to embed and 
promote sustainability  and to identify and realise the opportunities arising in the 
context of accelerating towards sustainability; 
• Embrace technological change and reform practices, curriculum, and research to 
realise the opportunities presented by the digital transition; 
• Critically evaluate emerging practice and technologies  in support of a just green 
transition facilitated by technological change;  
• Actively facilitate inter- and multi-disciplinary teaching, research and engagement  
activities. 
17 CONNECTING FOR IMPACT | Strategic Plan 2023-2028
APPROACH TO DEVELOPING THE STRATEGIC PLAN 
The Strategic Planning process 
commenced at SETU with the 
appointment of the university’s 
first President in July 2022. 
To assist and advise the 
President in the preparation of 
the Strategic Plan, a Strategic 
Plan Steering Group was 
convened from October 2022, 
chaired by the President and 
comprising members of the 
Executive Management Team 
and officers from the Students’ 
Unions. The Steering Group was 
supported by the University’s 
Strategic Planning Office 
and the University’s Project 
Management Office. 
A number of Working Groups 
were created as the principal 
vehicle through which key 
themes for the Plan were 
examined and reported on. The 
Working Groups comprised 
experts from across the 
University in these thematic 
areas, student membership 
and, in some cases, included 
external parties as part of their 
work. The Working Groups 
conducted policy scans in 
the relevant thematic area in 
order to contextualise activity 
within the thematic area, and 
then identified priority actions 
informed by the University’s 
vision, mission and values. Consultation  
The University committed to 
engaging in a deep, detailed 
consultation in support of its 
planning and a comprehensive 
consultation programme with 
both internal and external 
parties was put in place. This 
involved extensive meetings 
with staff, including dedicated 
meetings with staff trade 
unions, meetings with students, 
and a programme of external 
consultation through meetings 
with key stakeholders and 
stakeholder groups. The 
website featured an online 
submission form for inputs 
to the process. A full list of 
external stakeholders consulted 
as part of the Plan is given in 
Appendix A. 
Approval Process
A first complete draft of 
the Plan was presented to 
Governing Body in February 
2023. Following endorsement 
of the first draft, a further 
round of consultation took 
place with key external and 
internal stakeholders, including 
Academic Council. The final 
version of the Plan was 
approved by Governing Body in 
April 2023.

3 OUR INNOVATION
 AND RESEARCH
OUR AMBITION FOR OUR INNOVATION AND RESEARCH  
SETU aims to increase the volume, 
focus and impact of its research 
activity consistent with the 
profile of a leading research-led 
technological university and as the 
driving force behind an innovation 
region. We will focus on: 
• Increasing the knowledge 
capital of the region through 
enhancing the excellence of 
the research from within the 
University; 
• Connecting our quality 
research and knowledge to 
our education programmes, 
teaching and students; 
• Embedding entrepreneurship 
and leveraging opportunities 
for interdisciplinary research;  
• Applying new knowledge to 
solve global, national, regional 
and societal challenges and 
realise opportunities.
We will elevate the research 
performance of existing centres 
and build new centres of 
excellence in areas of regional 
need, with a focus on achieving 
internationally-accepted research 
performance measures. We aim 
to improve the quality of our 
research outputs with a particular 
focus on high-quality research publications, industry relevance, 
knowledge transfer and impact. 
We will consolidate and strengthen 
our support infrastructure for 
researchers in order to better 
support high-quality research and 
scholarship. As a research-led 
organisation, the University aims 
to deepen its culture of research 
by embedding research on all 
undergraduate programmes and 
ensuring strong linkages between 
teaching and research. 
We are informed in our planning in 
relation to Innovation and Research 
by our governing legislation which 
identifies several performance 
targets that require the elevation of 
research activity, graduate student 
recruitment and staff qualifications 
across the University. We will 
increase the percentage of our 
staff involved with the delivery of 
programmes at honours bachelor’s 
degree and above who hold a 
doctoral qualification to 65% by 
2032. Taking our current staff 
numbers as the baseline, we aim 
to increase the number of staff 
holding a PhD by 30% over the 
next 5 years to meet that target 
within a decade. We will increase 
our population of graduate 
students on research degrees to

end of this Plan. Furthermore, we will 
ensure that SETU has internationally-
recognised, high-quality research 
activity, with strong doctoral 
education programmes, in at least five 
academic domains. Informed by these ambitious targets, 
we will consolidate research activity 
in support of the creation of units 
of critical mass that will be the 
instrument to realise SETU’s research 
ambitions, elevating  at least one 
of the research areas identified as 
“Developing” in the figure below 
to the level of “Mature” within the

OUR AMBITION FOR OUR LEARNERS   
SETU will be distinguished by excellence 
in delivering an innovative, research-
informed, connected and applied 
curriculum. The SETU academic portfolio 
will be built on and informed by high 
academic standards, a record of research 
and scholarship, and deep connections 
to academic and professional networks. It 
will be responsive to our region and wider 
societal needs. 
We will provide an enriching and 
transformational learning experience 
that enables and supports our students 
to achieve their potential as lifelong 
learners and global citizens in a caring 
environment.SETU currently delivers programmes 
across multiple academic disciplines 
with the largest concentrations in Health 
and Welfare, Business and Engineering. 
An analysis of the programmes taken 
by students from the south east shows, 
however, significant gaps in coverage. 
Addressing these gaps in coverage with 
the introduction of some new disciplines 
to SETU over the course of this plan will 
contribute to addressing the outward 
migration of talent from the region 
(currently 61% of students from the region 
in higher education study outside the 
south east) and will form part of a planned 
increase in full-time student numbers of 
up to 1,800 by 2028.

work-plans for Academic Council, the Executive Management Team, 
and individual University units 
will reference and align with the 
implementation plan. Annual agreed 
work-plans of Executive members and 
the associated units will be expected 
to align with the Strategic Plan 
implementation. The plan will also 
integrate with other instruments of 
governance, including the University

9 CONCLUSION:   the Future University and
 the Future Region  
This Strategic Plan positions SETU at the heart of 
the south east Innovation Region. The Plan has 
set out objectives that place SETU, a new and 
ambitious university for Ireland, strongly on the 
trajectory to:  
a) Enhance the regional 
innovation ecosystem  based 
on cutting-edge, excellent 
research, in turn facilitating 
high-quality job creation in the 
knowledge economy; 
b) Facilitate more seamless 
transfer of knowledge  from 
the academy to partners —
enterprise, civic, and others —
as part of a more co-ordinated 
engagement effort that places 
the university in a lead role 
regionally; 
c) Address the regional brain 
drain, retaining  significantly 
greater numbers of regional 
students  in the south east, 
with knock-on impact on the 
regional talent pool and human 
capital resources; d) Attract significantly greater 
numbers of international 
students  to the university and 
therefore to the region, again 
adding to the talent pool and 
skills base; 
e) Expand the university 
footprint  through additional 
staff, additional buildings 
and additional investment in 
facilities; 
f) Sustain better regional, 
national and international 
partnerships  that make for a 
more connected region and 
allow for a greater flow of ideas 
and talent into the south east; 
g) Elevate  longer-term through 
the provision of educational 
opportunities the levels of 
educational attainment  of the 
regional population, enhancing 
regional quality of life.
80
SOUTH EAST TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY
81
CONNECTING FOR IMPACT | Strategic Plan 2023-2028
The university, as it scales and develops, will 
impact on the south east in multiple ways: 
a) The long-term impact of higher level 
qualifications on employability  and 
consequently earning power ; 
b) The impact of research, innovation 
and knowledge transfer, both 
directly in the shape of research 
funding that comes into the 
university and is expended 
regionally, and more importantly 
in terms of the cultivation of a 
dynamic regional innovation 
ecosystem  with impact on 
employment and job creation ; 
c) The attractiveness of the university 
to overseas students and staff, 
increasing the regional talent 
pool ;
d) the impact on culture, society, and 
the community  more broadly from 
the creation of a large-scale, high-
performing organisation and the 
centre of the south east;
e) Its direct impact through direct 
expenditure on the regional 
economy, amplified  as the 
university grows in scale;f) The indirect and induced impacts 
of expenditure on the economy , 
again amplified  as the organization 
grows. 
This strategy plans for the 
transformation of SETU. In turn, the 
plan projects the transformational 
impact of SETU over the coming five 
years and after on the south east 
region and beyond.
SETU’s ambitions must be matched 
with investment from Government to 
support our organisational and physical 
transformation. While SETU will make 
determined efforts to diversify its 
non-exchequer sources of income, 
the funding for capital projects in the 
order of €350m over the next five 
years, will require dedicated support 
from Government to deliver balanced 
regional development in support of a 
vibrant and thriving South East.
