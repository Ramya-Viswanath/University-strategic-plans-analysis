MISSION 
Our distinct mission, as Missouri's only state-supported member of 
the Association of American Universities, is to provide all Missourians the benefts of a world-class research university. We are stewards and builders of a priceless state resource, a unique physical infrastructure and scholarly environment in which our tightly interlocked missions of teaching, research, service and economic development work together on behalf of all citizens. Students work side by side with some of the world's best faculty to advance the arts and humanities, the sciences and the professions. Scholarship and teaching are daily driven by a commitment to public service — the obligation to produce and disseminate knowledge that will improve the quality of life in the state, the nation and the world.

STATEMENT OF VALUES 
The University of Missouri, as the state's major land-grant university, honors the public trust placed in it and 
accepts the associated accountability to the people of Missouri for its stewardship of that trust. Our duty is to acquire, create, transmit and preserve knowledge and to promote understanding. 
We the students, faculty and staf of MU hold the following values to be the foundation of our identity as a 
community. We pledge ourselves to act, in the totality of our life together, in accord with these values. 
RESPECT 
Respect for one's self and for others is the founda-tion of honor and the basis of integrity. A hallmark of our community is respect — for the process by which we seek truths and for those who engage in that process. Such respect is essential for nurturing the free and open discourse, exploration and creative expression that characterize a university. Respect results in dedication to individual as well as collective expressions of truth and honesty. Respect is demon-strated by a commitment to act ethically, to welcome diference, and to engage in open exchange about both ideas and decisions. 
RESPONSIBILITY 
A sense of responsibility requires careful refection on one's moral obligations. Being responsible impos-es the duty on us and our university to make deci-sions by acknowledging the context and considering consequences, both intended and unintended, of any course of action. Being responsible requires us to be thoughtful stewards of resources — accountable to ourselves, each other and the publics we serve. DISCOVERY 
Learning requires trust in the process of discovery. Discovery often fractures existing world views and requires acceptance of uncertainty and ambiguity. Therefore, the university must support all its mem-bers in this lifelong process that is both challenging and rewarding. As we seek greater understanding and wisdom, we also recognize that knowledge itself has boundaries. What we know is not all that is. 
EXCELLENCE 
We aspire to an excellence that is approached through diligent efort, both individual and collective. Pursuing excellence means being satisfed with no less than the highest goals we can envision. Pursuing excellence involves being informed by regional, na-tional and global standards, as well as our personal expectations. We recognize and accept the sacrifc-es, risks and responsibilities involved in pursuing ex -
cellence, and so we celebrate each other's successes. We commit ourselves to this process in an ethical and moral manner. 
These statements are mere words until we integrate them as values in our individual lives and refect them in our institutional policies and practices. We pledge ourselves to make them efective in the very fabric of our lives, our community, and all our relationships with others, thereby enhancing the development of individuals and the well-being of society.

Thanks to the fortitude and foresight of the people of Missouri, the University of Missouri, the frst public university west of the Mississippi River, was born in 1839. To this day, MU honors the trust placed in it by the citizens of Missouri to live out its duty to acquire, create, transmit and preserve knowledge and promote understanding. 
As a comprehensive research university, we are privileged to extend our research, learning, en-
gagement and economic development beyond our campus. Our mission starts here but our impact is global. 
The plan that follows speaks to our commitment in fve critical areas: 
• Excellence in Student Success 
• Excellence in Research and Creative Works 
• Excellence in Engagement and Outreach 
• Inclusive Excellence 
• Excellence in Planning, Operations and Stewardship 
By creating excellence in every realm, we will work to become the exemplar that the citizens of 
Missouri envisioned when they created the University. In so doing we will prepare our students and citizens for leadership in a diverse, global and technology-driven environment. 
Our plan embodies our commitment to our students, faculty, staf, alumni and the larger communi-
ty. In this commitment is our recognition that while we are the University of Missouri, we are really the University for  Missouri. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI SYSTEM 
The University of Missouri System was formed in 1963 and consists of system administration and four universities: the University of Missouri-
Columbia, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the Missouri University of Science and Technology, the University of Missouri-St. Louis, and all of their component parts, including, but not limited to, MU Health, MU Extension and UM Engagement (“University” or “UM System”). 
The UM System is organized as a system to achieve more collectively than its component parts could achieve individually and this principle will 
guide decision makers in managing the afairs of the UM System, whether they be in academic, research or in business operations. Moreover, the UM System exists to deliver excellence in teaching, research & creative works, economic development, engagement and inclusion. 
It is the fundamental responsibility of UM System universities and leaders to efectively manage resources to achieve the vision and mission of the 
UM System. This fundamental responsibility compels all to look beyond individual universities and interests to enable the UM System to meet the needs of the people of Missouri, the nation and the world.

GOAL 1. CREATE A CULTURE OF EXCELLENCE 
RELATED TO SCHOLARSHIP THROUGH INCENTIVE, RECOGNITION AND ADVANCEMENT PROGRAMS FOR FACULTY, STAFF AND STUDENTS.   
EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH 
& CREATIVE WORKS 
UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI
 
 
 
 
 
 
  21 
The University of Missouri is a premier research institution 
with faculty, staf and students creating and discovering new technologies, arts, media content and publications every day that transform the lives of Missourians and citizens of the globe. 
Our mission and our identity as a land-grant institution are rooted 
in excellence. With annual research expenditures more than $200 million, there are only a few dozen comparable public institutions in the United States with research and creative works portfolios like ours. MU’s membership in the Association of American Universities (AAU) is refective of our research and overall scholarship prominence. 
Our research and creative works productivity is built upon a 
talented community of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, staf and faculty. As we enhance the national visibility of our scholarship through a host of new strategies, we will capitalize on the increased opportunities to recruit for this talented pipeline. All will see MU as a place where they can be mentored and build their own foundations for success. 
Our culture will embrace support of our students, our faculty and 
our staf to contribute to our impactful scholarship. 
We strive to deliver the type of discovery that improves the quality 
of life for the people we serve, and the type of cultural enrichment that society needs. To do this, our faculty and staf must have the opportunity to pursue their innovative ideas. 
ROOM TO GROW 
While MU’s history is rightfully a point of pride, there is signifcant opportunity to improve. As an institution, several of our current research measures are below that of other comparable public research universities (and particularly true of our AAU public peers). This is true of research expenditures, books, journal publications, awards and citations.  
To ensure we continue to be one of the leading research 
universities in the world, we are implementing a university-wide research and creative works growth plan during fall 2018, and will develop specifc school and college plans built around the overarching university-wide plan. 
This is not about chasing metrics. Our plans outlined in the 
goals that follow focus on delivering the type of discovery and enrichment that society needs and expects from MU. 
The goals outlined here will only be accomplished though the 
hard work of our faculty, staf and students. Their willingness to take risks, be nimble and support creativity is why MU remains a destination for talented colleagues from many felds of study. STRATEGIES 
A. Redevelop incentive programs to align with our research goals at MU. 
• Launch a working group of faculty in August 2018 (named by MU’s Provost and Vice Chancellor for Research) charged with developing recommendations for future incentive programs at MU by February 2019 for fscal year 2020. 
• Develop a culture of recognition identifying new, meaningful ways to celebrate and award faculty who publish books and other top publications within their feld. 
B. Build development programs for faculty, students, staf and postdocs that will support and enable our scholars to develop their research skills. These programs include: 
• Launch a continuous education program for faculty, students and postdocs to meet the changing expectations of scholarship across all disciplines. 
• Ofer support through preproposal grant review by leveraging existing expertise. 
• Support the continued improvement of university library resources: a key contributor to the growth of the research and creative output of MU’s faculty, staf and students. 
C. Develop a faculty enhancement program that builds on MU’s research and professional development leave options. 
D. Launch the Artist in Residence program (September 2018) 
to highlight and build on our excellence in the humanities and creative works. 
• Establish the semester- or year-long residency for emerging artists from MU and beyond who will engage students in classrooms, studios and performance venues.

BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS EXCELLENCE IN ENGAGEMENT & 
OUTREACH 
As a continuously evolving land-grant institution, the University of 
Missouri is reimagining what it means to be a land-grant institution — this time for the 21st century. Much of the reimagining relates to delivering outcomes to address ongoing challenges that were identifed through a statewide needs assessment. Those challenges correlate with economic opportunity, healthy futures and educa-tional access. 
Missouri’s prosperity, competitive position, and social and cultural 
richness are enhanced by MU’s ongoing commitment to educate and engage citizens; strengthen democratic values and responsi-bility; address crucial societal issues; and contribute to the public good — on campus and throughout the state’s 114 counties and metro areas. 
As a respected leader in higher education and as Missouri’s leading 
land-grant university, MU demonstrates excellence in engage-ment and outreach through activities and initiatives conducted by colleges, schools, units and as part of the University of Missouri System. 
Through discovery and the translation of research into technolo-
gies, information, programs and services that contribute to prob-lem-solving and societal enrichment, MU improves lives, commu-nities and economies. Its impact on Missouri, the nation and the world is unsurpassed in the feld of higher education. 
At MU, excellence in engagement and outreach is characterized by: 
A climate that values each individual involved in the process. This is true for of-campus and on-campus eforts that, through engagement, seek active participation from or touch faculty, students, staf, alumni, donors, athletics supporters, stakeholders, public and private entities and communities. Efective outreach programs based on meaningful impact. Such programs are visible through campus-based initiatives, MU Exten-sion and its county-based network, MU Health Care, MU Athletics and collaboratively through System-wide initiatives.  Innovative partnerships for economic and workforce development. This activity draws from the breadth of MU and the UM System, and collaborates with a wide range of public and private entities.

INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE 
The university strives to be a 21st century learning community 
defned by excellence through the afrmation of diferences in the composition of its leadership, faculty, staf and students; the confguration of its policies, procedures, organizational structures, curricula and co-curricular programs; and the fabric of its interper-sonal relationships. 
This diversity framework expresses a plan for enacting the univer-
sity’s larger mission, and for its values. We shaped this plan using our core values: respect, responsibility, discovery and excellence. 
MU defnes diversity broadly as the various mix or combinations of 
human diferences. This allows our entire constituency to envision their identity or multiple identities within this inclusive defnition. 
MU has adopted an Inclusive Excellence model, which hinges on a 
cohesive, coherent and collaborative integration of diversity, inclu-sion and equity into MU’s pursuit of excellence. 
Accepting the Inclusive Excellence model refects an understand-
ing that diversity, inclusion and equity are catalysts for institutional and educational excellence, and are not isolated initiatives. Diver-sity will be invited and integrated into the very core of MU’s edu-cational enterprise, including our recruiting, hiring and admissions processes, our curriculum and co-curriculum, and our administra-tive structures and practices.

BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS EXCELLENCE IN PLANNING,
OPERATIONS & STEWARDSHIP 
In line with the continued pursuit of excellence, we must assess 
how we invest all of our resources at the University of Missouri. Strategy drives budget, and that mantra must be part of the cam-pus culture. Our ability and willingness to focus is especially crucial during the current fnancial climate within higher education. We value the investment that taxpayers make in us, and the dollars our students invest in themselves through tuition. 
To show how much we value it, we commit to being transparent 
about how we use time, money and personnel. Transparency will help us be the stable, trusted university that Missouri deserves. At MU, we want to continue to be good stewards in every sense of the phrase. 
In addition to becoming more transparent to our internal and 
external stakeholders, we want to commit to embracing deci-sion-making informed by data – and, of course, context – through-out all levels of the university. To achieve our lofty yet attainable goals, we need to focus resources on MU’s areas of strength to continue to diferentiate the university. Identifying areas of excel-lence, as we develop new processes and create new budget mod-els, among other things, will be greatly informed by data moving forward. 
Because strategy drives budget, we are also rethinking the way 
we allocate resources across campus. A group of faculty, staf, stu-dents and administrators were charged in spring 2018 to reconsid-er how we allocate our resources and to identify new models that would address critical needs and investment opportunities. 
Self-evaluation is key in becoming the type of innovative, compre-
hensive fagship university that we strive to be. 
With the help of a University of Missouri System-led efort, MU 
completed an Administrative Review in December 2017 with the goals of identifying administrative efciencies and streamlining op-erations by reducing redundancies across administrative functions. 
As of the beginning of the 2018-2019 academic year, we are 
making strides in adjusting operations structures because of this review. A campus community-led steering committee worked with external consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers to identify inefcien-cies, fnd improvement opportunities in human resources, informa-tion technology and fnance that could drive higher productivity. 
We intend on turning this process into something that helps the 
culture at MU. We want to increase retention, performance and job satisfaction by identifying where inefciencies occur and working through those with the help of our employees.  
As part of this, we have to rethink the way that the university is 
organized. According to the Activity Analysis Survey that was conducted in spring 2018 (with a 96 percent completion rate), there are work redundancies that we need to address. Our employees showed us that there are places where, with some creativity, we could help them better use their skills and time. 
It is clear we can make gains in the services delivered in these 
administrative areas.  Improvement of the tools employees have to use will enable us to free up time wasted by inefective and outdated processes. 
GOAL 1:  STRIVE TO ENSURE A SAFE LEARNING, 
LIVING AND WORK ENVIRONMENT. 
STRATEGIES 
A. Continue to foster a culture of safety through a wide range of 
services to the MU campus community.  
• We are one of the top schools in the nation when it comes 
to safety resources, ofering members of the campus community numerous opportunities to enhance their safety through training and classes. We will continue these best practices. 
B. Coordinate semi-annual emergency management and safe-ty drills and test the emergency notifcation system. Mizzou’s robust emergency plan is co-directed by the MU Police Chief and the Director of Environmental Health & Safety. Mizzou has estab-lished a good relationship with city, county and school district ofcials who meet monthly to discuss safety measures. 
C. Identify, purchase and oversee a comprehensive integrated 
camera system for university buildings and properties. Currently, there are more than 900 decentralized analog cameras cam-pus wide; centralizing monitoring and purchasing an additional 1,000 surveillance cameras will provide a more reliable safety/ security system. 
D. Provide (Citizens Response to Active Threat, self-defense, 
lab safety, etc.) training in locations across campus and after hours to reach the campus community as well as provide faculty and staf with emergency evacuation plans, guidance in lock-ing classrooms during a threat and other emergency planning procedures. 
E. Recruit and hire a diverse police ofcer work force that mir-
rors the campus community with the goal of increasing depart-ment strength to 50 sworn ofcers.

GOAL 2. ENSURE THAT STRATEGY DRIVES 
BUDGET. 
STRATEGIES 
A. Implement a new resource allocation model that gives trans-
parency into what drives our revenues and expenses. This new model will highlight our commitment to our mission and prior-ities. Through that transparency and priority setting, individual decision makers will be more empowered to make decisions in alignment with MU’s overarching goals. 
• Explore new model options through the Resource Allocation Model Committee, which will make recommendations during fscal year 2019 that will then be widely vetted, communicated and tested across the university. 
• Ensure during fscal year 2020 that adoption of the new model goes as smoothly as possible, thereby avoiding costly unintended consequences. 
• Adopt the new model for revenue and expense allocation starting fscal year 2021. 
B. Create a strong fnancial accountability environment. Each decision maker who manages resources on MU’s behalf will be expected to demonstrate their adherence to sound fnancial practices in the context of meeting the academic, programmatic and mission objectives for which they are responsible. 
• Develop reporting tools to track goals and metrics. These tools will give these individuals the information they need to meet these expectations. 
• Develop goals and metrics with our stakeholders for every level of the university enterprise to provide clarity about how each unit fts into broader goals and expectations. 
• Conduct consistent review of progress against these goals and metrics at all levels. 
C. Analyze results from the activity analysis survey to study the level of, and cost associated with, the current central and distributed organization of human resources and fnance work at MU. This data will inform decisions regarding how to improve services and efciency. 
• Develop data packets for each college, school and division (CSD) based on the survey information. 
• Evaluate the data with stakeholder groups and make recommendations regarding opportunities for efciency and efectiveness gains within each CSD. 
• Insight from each analysis will inform possible university-wide changes to improve service, efciency and efectiveness. GOAL 3. EXPAND AND REFINE CURRENT USES OF 
DATA IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. 
STRATEGIES 
A. Create the Ofce of Institutional Efectiveness to promote 
and coordinate data in decision-making throughout all critical operations on campus and within the UM System. (This strategy also appears in the Research and Creative Works section of this plan.) 
GOAL 4. PRODUCE NET NEW REVENUES THAT 
HELP US CONTINUE TO KEEP MU AFFORDABLE. 
STRATEGIES 
A. Examine the current tuition and fee levels to fnd ways we can 
simplify the structure for students while assessing how appro-priate our current rates compare to the market rate of similar programs.  
• Align the cost of programs with what we charge. This is critical, as students increasingly become the primary payer for their education. 
• Identify and take advantage of all cost-savings opportunities, without cutting corners in program delivery. Making programs less expensive at the cost of the quality students expect from MU is unacceptable. 
B. Through the student success initiatives highlighted in the frst compact of this plan, improved student retention will have a positive fnancial impact for MU. 
C. Support the expansion of programs both online and on 
campus where there is strong demand – and therefore revenue opportunities. 
D. Foster an environment that encourages pursuit of entrepre-
neurial activities, as outlined in the Research and Creative Works compact. 
• Address and intervene where there are impediments to progress. 
• Provide fexibility wherever we can to allow for investment in ventures, ideas and strategies. 
GOAL 6: REDUCE DEFICIENT FACILITY SQUARE 
FOOTAGE IN ORDER TO REALLOCATE SAVINGS TO BUILDINGS THAT IMPROVE AND SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS, OUTREACH AND RESEARCH. 
general (E&G) space. Consultants’ building assessment 
surveys of E&G facilities have identifed 43 buildings in need of renovation, removal or replacement. 
B. Refne Mizzou Stewardship Model to include a process for space reduction and invest recaptured operations dollars to cre-ate, support and maintain existing and future high-performing campus buildings. 
• The Mizzou Stewardship Model addresses deferred 
maintenance by using E&G facility maintenance allocations wisely to complete renovations that bring buildings up to current life safety and ADA codes while providing state-of-the-art facilities for today’s academic community. 
• This model eliminated $56.75M of deferred maintenance in 
six academic buildings while adding 412 classroom seats, 232 STEM class lab stations, almost 40,000 gross square feet of additional space and improved collaboration/study areas by repurposing previously unusable space due to condition. 
• Ensure that footprint reduction eliminates waste without 
compromising programs or resources benefting students, staf, faculty and the community. 
GOAL 7. REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS 
AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF SERVICES WITHIN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
STRATEGIES 
A. Focus IT eforts and create changes that improve efciencies, 
improve quality, reduce cost and facilitate innovation. As these changes create savings, we will move dollars from IT to the aca-demic mission of the university. 
B. Design and implement an integrated IT organization that 
spans across the university. 
• In collaboration with diverse institutional leaders and 
incorporating the data gathered in the Activity Analysis, we identifed the high-level deliverables that will form the foundation of the new IT organization: 
o Organizational structure: Reporting lines and feedback 
loops to foster accountability. 
o Role defnitions: Detailed mapping of interdependent 
roles, points of authority and decision-making 
modalities. 
o Human resource mapping and tasking: Placing 
people into roles to maximize the efciency of the new 
organization.

verse and collaborative – and one that inspires excellence. 
C. Create a workplace culture that values faculty and staf health 
and wellbeing – physically, mentally and socially. 
D. Optimize MU’s service delivery models by driving opportuni-
ties to: 
• Streamline manual and transactional work to create efciencies and implement opportunities for shared services; 
• Create centers of expertise to develop and execute strategy, policies and procedures; 
• Defne how services are to be delivered on campus to support inquiries, advice and consultation for leadership; and 
• Evaluate where there are needs to meet external market forces and allow appropriate variations from common business practices in fnance and human resources. 
E. Evaluate and implement policy improvements, which impact efectiveness and efciencies. 
F. Evaluate variations across processes, programs and operations 
to identify common approaches and mitigate risk. 
G. Evaluate the return on investment of existing and new tech-
nologies in support of efciency and efectiveness, as well as improved data analytics and reporting. 
STRATEGIES 
A. Reduce square footage by 750,000 gross square feet by 2023 
• Facility needs for campus total $786 million, with a growth rate of $35 million in annual deferred maintenance. At the current growth rate, by 2025 the total projected deferred maintenance need will be more than $1 billion, and this is without adding a single square foot to education and

• Management and administration 
• Security and compliance 
• Infrastructure operations 
• End user support 
• IT development 
• Application support 
• Research IT support 
• Academic IT support 
D. Model and advocate for the increased use of digital tools to improve workfow efciencies, process integration across units and universities, and data-facilitated decision-making. 
E. Eliminate duplications of efort within the integrated IT orga-
nization. 
F. Standardize and leverage economies of scale across all divi-
sions, with savings directed toward the academic mission. 
Through our new structure, focus and coordinated eforts, we 
will create capacity and governance for technology innovation as a lever to support the university’s missions, within and out-side IT.

  IMPLEMENTATION 
THE WA Y44 
Our bold vision for Mizzou is built on our core 
values of excellence, discovery, responsibility and respect. While we have challenges, there is a mo-mentum for change leading the way. 
As identifed in the compacts above, our success 
is critically dependent on the caliber of human, physical, technological and organizational capital in which we invest. 
The implementation strategies that will pave the 
way to success rely on the following enablers: 
INVESTMENTS IN PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND TECHNOLOGY 
Our physical and technology infrastructure must support and grow 
with the needs refective of our lofty goals. 
We must consider ways to use space more efciently and incentiv -
ize strategic space reductions. We must consider decommissioning 
and demolishing old buildings that no longer meet today’s stan-dards for research and teaching and invest in facilities remediation where needed. Our physical and technological infrastructure must grow to support research excellence so we can double externally funded research. 
Our aspirations for doubling research also call for signifcant in-
vestments in new centers of excellence like the TPMC, the Institute for Nano and Molecular Innovations Facilities Development and new core facilities development. We must develop support struc-tures in sponsored projects, grant project management and data analytics so productive researchers can focus on grant writing, rather than grant management and administration. Related to this, we must invest in additional space to create new facilities such as a Visitor Center, Student Success Center and Transfer Student Cen-ter, which will help us achieve our student success goals. 
Other investments such as a Center for Engagement and Out-
reach, an Executive Education Conference facility, a Center for First Responder Excellence, will help us reach our goal of creating high-touch experiences for citizens across the state. 
Finally, a world class data center, computing, storage and network -
ing enhancements and investments in disaster recovery systems 
will protect the integrity of our data-informed work. 
BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS INVESTMENTS IN HUMAN CAPITAL 
We recognize that the most valuable opportunities lie in the hu-
man capital investments we make. Our people defne our possibili-ties, and the possibilities are endless. 
During the next fve years, we must hire strategically. Our faculty, 
staf and administrators will enable us to achieve our goals in every compact in this strategic plan. At the same time, we must invest in professional development across the broad spectrum of disciplines at MU that contribute to the enrichment of the lives of everyone. Thus, we must ensure that we have a full range of development and recognition programs that enable and recognize all who are helping us achieve our goals. 
Recruiting the most sought after researchers, the most engaging 
teachers and the most dedicated staf members is key to en-abling the implementation of our plan. In addition, we must invest in talent management systems that reward high achievers in all areas. We must create incentive programs that make it easy for exceptional researchers to excel. By creating nimble recruitment processes, well-defned promotion policies and agile retention sys-tems, we will better retain our highest performers. We expect our faculty to excel at teaching, research and engagement, and we val-ue them for that. Additionally, we must ensure continuous learning opportunities for faculty and staf, and our promotion standards must be rigorous so we promote and tenure the best in their feld. 
ALLOCATION SYSTEMS THAT ALIGN INCENTIVES 
WITH GOALS 
We must create budget and incentive allocation systems that lead 
to decisions and actions that will help us achieve our goals. 
We are working to create new models for allocating the budget 
that reward research excellence, student success, inclusive excel-lence and community engagement. Additionally, our allocation models must continue to reward interdisciplinary collaborations. 
SHARED SERVICES MODEL 
We must create models that drive operational efciencies, shared capabilities and integration of systems that avoid duplication. The range of opportunities where we increase integrated support and reduce duplication has grown over time – from systems that allow for integration of health, counseling and wellbeing and disability of students, to centralized Title IX training, to IT, HR and security services for students. 
We must consider ways to share services across areas in a way 
that reduce costs and increases integration. Developing a support infrastructure that incentivizes resource sharing, efciencies in HR, operations and administrative support will lead us to savings we can reinvest in the core mission of the university – education, research and engagement. DATA-DRIVEN, AND AGILE DECISION MAKING 
Technology and data analytics enable us to build systems that foster data-informed decision-making. We must invest in technol-ogy and data-support systems that foster build upon that mo-mentum in using data to make decisions, promote learning agility and allow us to incorporate healthier governance mechanisms in decision-making. 
RESPECT FOR DIFFERENCES 
We must create a learning environment that attracts a diverse student population and a work environment where diferences are respected. We must engage community leaders to grow institu-tional diversity and inclusion, and to provide access and resources to people from underrepresented groups. 
TELLING OUR STORY 
To improve the way we tell MU’s collective story, we have to ensure that stakeholders understand institutional goals and can see how their role at the university contributes to our collective success. 
We must create a communications infrastructure capable of pro-
viding strategic institutional publications and marketing campaigns that drive MU’s key messages to critical audiences to help drive en-rollment, elevate our reputation and demonstrate progress toward the goals we laid out in this strategic plan. 
Aligning our branding and core messages related to institutional 
priorities will go a long way toward achieving our goals and capi-talizing on the talent that exists across campus in academic units and from within the Joint Ofce of Strategic Communications and Marketing. 
CREATIVE WAYS TO FUND OUR PRIORITIES 
With state support declining and limits to tuition increases, we must consider creative new ways to expand our fnancial resourc-es. We must increase donor support for student scholarships, centers of excellence, buildings, technology and other types of physical infrastructure. At the same time, we must consider new and unique ways to fundraise for administrative and operational excellence that furthers efciency and augments fexibility. 
In addition to centers like the Translational Precision Medicine 
Complex, the generosity of our donors ofers a compelling case for philanthropic support of programs like Artist in Residence, which highlights our excellence in the humanities and creative endeavors. 
We must also develop corporate partnerships to support programs 
that drive student success, teaching excellence and community engagement. Identifying creative, innovative revenue streams by leveraging our emerging technologies and strategic hires will help us better capitalize on those opportunities.

GRATITUDE 
The strategies outlined in this document are clearly 
the result of collective wisdom brought to bear by several stakeholders. We are grateful to everyone who provided input for this roadmap. 
This is a living plan that will grow and develop – it 
may change as circumstances warrant, but it will al-ways be true in spirit to the values enshrined in our compact:  Respect, Responsibility, Discovery and Excellence. 
“[The University’s] foremost concern is for 
and with instruction on its campus, teach-ing the youth of the state. Indeed, is not this the greatest work we can do? I think so ... But this instruction may not confne itself to the campus and to the years spent here. It is an incomplete education that stops at commencement, or confnes it -
self to those in the classroom in personal touch with the instructor, however valu-able, undoubtedly, classroom instruction.”
