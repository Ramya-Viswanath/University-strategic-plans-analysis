At the National University of La Plata, 18 years ago, we proposed
transform ourselves based on a guiding idea: have a management plan to grow,
something unthinkable at that time. To carry out this idea it was necessary
make common work possible among those of us who think differently, and that is how
We generate a space for democratic debate among all university faculty
to develop the UNLP Strategic Plan.
With this new form of management, at UNLP we experienced a process of
unprecedented growth in history. Not only in infrastructural terms (buildings,
equipment, technology, inputs) - perhaps the most obvious - but also in
number of students, teachers and non-teachers, in the continuity of their studies
permanent, in accompanying the training and work process through the
comprehensive university welfare system, in diversity of degree courses and
postgraduate, in alternative formal education through trades in training
professional, in laboratories and resources for research, in activities
multiple extensions, in presence in the territory with community centers and a
Regional Extension Center, in artistic and cultural production with a Center
University of Art, a Graduate Center and a Convention Center, in
production and transfer through “factories” such as the Technological Center of the
Madera, the Food Plant for Social Inclusion, the Medicines Plant, the
Vaccines and Lithium Batteries, among other targeted developments. We reinforce the
regional identity, also locating us in Berisso and Ensenada, and integrating with
different units the most important health training and production system
of the country, along with the province of Buenos Aires.
We are a growing, complex and dynamic institution that required and requires
a structure in accordance and that establishes with the Strategic Plan an instrument in
permanent process of review, updating and evaluation where the
lines of work for each area. With the general quarterly reports and the
specific to specific demands, we realize what the structure of the
The whole of the University produces from planning and management, its state
of execution and compliance, not only as a form of constant evaluation, but also
also to make the use of public resources transparent through processes
educational, cultural, productive, scientific, artistic, that is, university.
From the National University of La Plata we work, on the basis of defense
of the ideas of the University Reform and its historical complements, so that the
Free public education becomes the engine of the country's development and
a more egalitarian society, and with that objective we created and developed this Plan
 
that is accountable, raises difficulties and finds solutions
transformative, inclusive, to contribute to an emancipatory patriotic destiny.
 
Production of Transparency in Management
The strategic planning process initiated in 2004 is based,
fundamentally, in three axes: available administration tools
publicly; centralization of academic, scientific and
administrative; and operational integration with the entire state system
educational, legal and administrative management control.
The different management instances, the evaluation of said processes and the
collective participation of both the Presidency staff and each of the
the Academic Units (Faculties and Colleges) and Extension Agencies, the
Research, Transfer, Production, Art and Culture, Health, care
environmental, Human Rights and Equality Policies, Relationships
Institutional, have resulted in batteries of normative, operational instruments
and procedural that, at the same time that they give us modern solutions of
precision for daily work and compliance with the demands of
public information, efficient and responsible communication, open administration,
They reinforce the precepts of constitutional Autonomy that governs and empowers us.
In the management period that we are beginning, we will continue and reinforce
the initiated processes of paper removal, integrated electronic systematization,
permanent communication of information, deepening not only the
self-assumed responsibility, but finally instituting a public culture of
open government, transparency in procedures that are often opaque due to
complexity of the issues we address, democratic will and
Republican.

UNLP Strategic Plan
  
 
 

 
The National University of La Plata assumes the responsibility of producing
socially and scientifically transformative knowledge, committed to the
destiny of our country and with that of each of the inhabitants, in solidarity and
challenging with their needs and potentials. The Teaching, the
Research, Extension, Transfer, Production, Linkage,
Management, Administration, Health, Environmental care, Art and Culture,
are the main functions that he assumes with the conviction of the character of the
Higher Education as a public and social good, as a human right
universal and as the responsibility of the State, and in effective dialogue with the
Latin American tradition born from the University Reform of 1918.
Since 2004, we have been working discussing the fundamental strategic lines
so that the Plan has a participatory, plural character and implementation,
transformative, from its elaboration, development and evaluation
collectives. The university community as a whole discusses the lines
fundamental strategic objectives, defining specific policies regarding
Teaching, Research, Extension and Institutional Links, Art and
Culture, Production and Transfer and Administration, Management and Control.
The Plan is the reflection of the institutional political project that allows the
Public University think about what are the steps and scenarios to
function in the best way, encouraging internal debate and
discussion about the objectives to be achieved. This document points out
the particularities of the Strategic Plan corresponding to the period 20 22-
2026, for the entire UNLP, taking into account the complexity of the task that
demand, with General and Specific Programs, with Subprograms and
Operational Subprograms, Projects and Works.
 
Public University: Inclusion and development
The strategic objectives proposed for this Plan synthesize the themes and
general positions emerging from a constant debate, which forms
part of the daily participatory planning process that gave rise to the
preparation and management of the Strategic Plan in the periods 2004 -2007, 2007 -
2010, 2010 -2014, 2014 -2018, 2018 -2022 and constitutes the structural basis of the
present .
 
The Plan in the period 2004-2007 was headed by a General Objective,
and an Institutional Development Model, and structured in five lines
strategic strategies focused on Teaching, Research, Extension,
Institutional Relations and Management; which were made up of 22
General Programs, made up of 112 Programs and 236 Projects
Institutional, in addition to 56 recovery and maintenance works of the
building infrastructure and 54 new works.
The period 2007-2010 maintained the general structure of the Plan, in terms of its
General Objective, its Development Model and its Strategic Lines, this time
made up of 22 General Programs, 79 Programs, 132 Subprograms,
430 Operational Subprograms and Projects and 193 building works.
The period 2010-2014 once again ratified the general structure of the Plan, in
regarding its General Objective, its Development Model and its Lines
Strategic, made up of 20 General Programs, 58 Programs, 160
Subprograms, 600 Operational Subprograms and Projects and 252 works
buildings.
The period 2014-2018 added the Art and Culture Strategy, being from
then six that make up the general structure of the Plan, and advanced in
regarding its General Objective, its Development Model and its Lines
Strategic, made up of 2 4 General Programs, 61 Programs, 170
Subprograms, 630 Operational Subprograms and Projects and 315 works
buildings.
The period 2018 –2022 ratified the general structure of six Strategies, their
General Objective, its Development Model and its Strategic Lines,
made up of 2 5 General Programs, 85 Programs, 225 Subprograms,
680 Operational Subprograms and Projects and 320 building works.
 
The plan for the period 2004 -2022 is completed. All your programs and
projects were implemented. Those permanent ones remained
throughout the entire process and those semi-permanent and transitory ones that
They had a fulfillable objective, which exhausted them upon reaching it, they were fulfilled in
the period or are in the process of doing so (this is the case of the works of
infrastructure with an execution period that transcends the period). The balance
regarding the articulation of the Plan with the contemporary axes of the debate
 
of university higher education at the various scales and in terms of
the guidelines debated at the University itself is satisfactory, as is
than in terms of the level of compliance and evolution of the Plan itself.
For this reason, eighteen years after its inception, the government of the
University proposed to sustain, update and review the results,
taking advantage of the experience of the entire journey between 2004 -2022, to
further broaden its reach to the entire UNLP and reformulate the plan
with a new management horizon of four years (20 22-2026), reaffirming
the institutional development model that confirms the mission of our
University, the vision shared by all the cloisters of the objective
general to achieve, and the meaning of six fundamental strategies,
restructuring them based on evaluation and distinctive meaning
prospective with which we are looking forward to the Future. We reformulate programs
and projects based on permanent changes in the scenario in which
the Institution develops, of the evolution in the fulfillment of objectives
programmatic and projectual objectives previously established, and the need to
achieve others, identified as necessary, priority and possible to
this stage of the process.

The need to continue with this topic is based on the requirement
consolidated requirement of having an agreed management plan, with scope and
identified and delimited priorities, based on a precise diagnosis and
in an oriented forecast of the scenario in which it will have to be
unwrap, a) to orient and verify the direction that the whole of the
Institution and its Community intend to give to its activities, b) to render
accounts of progress and results before the society that needs and maintains
the public university and c) to justify its support and demand
budgetary.
In the beginning stage, the intention to deepen the process is affirmed
of participation, to incorporate the opinion and demands of the most diverse
sectors of society and others from the university community itself and at
At the same time, fundamental reforms are proposed within the
institution aimed at deepening entry policies,
permanence and graduation in degree training, to greater articulation
with the undergraduate, to a growth and integration of the postgraduate among its
 
careers and directing new proposals to social issues and problems,
productive and environmental, that demand specific knowledge, at a
growth of the scientific and technological system with a strong promotion of
lines of research oriented to topics of interest for development
sustainability of our country and a growth of the processes of
transfer and production, to a greater responsible role in the
university social action, seeking to consolidate the progress made in the
community integration, to a personnel policy that responds to a greater
balance to the needs of children, teachers and the elderly
dedications of the Faculties, Colleges and dependencies, to a
consolidation of student and community-wide services
university, to adequate infrastructure and equipment and to management
budget that takes into account the particularities of the reality of each
UNLP area.
The Plan in progress is headed by a General Objective, which defines the
shared vision of what the UNLP should be like, a Development Model that
defines the mission assumed by the UNLP and which is contained in article 1 of
its Statute, and six strategic lines that address Teaching,
Research, Extension and Institutional Linkages, Art and
Culture, Production and Transfer, and Administration, Management and
Control . These strategies are made up of a set of 36
general programs, in turn made up of 127 specific programs,
311 subprograms and 891 operational subprograms, institutional projects
and works (transitory), which are renewed with varying frequency, depending on
have achieved their particular objective. Which adds up to a total of 1371
institutional spaces of action and production.
The content of Plan 20 22-2026 can be summarized as follows:

Ultimately, it translates and systematizes the range of actions necessary to
consolidate the fundamental reason for being of the Public University in our
country, based on serving the community and helping it progress. Indispensable
to accompany it to achieve its fundamental objectives that are synthesized
in forming students and graduates as citizens with ethical values and
firm social and a strong critical spirit, in generating more and better
national knowledge, transfer it and make it effective in producing development
and social progress, in being increasingly closer to society helping in
their most urgent needs, in getting more young people to enter, that more
students remain and more graduates leave the university,
without sacrificing quality – excellence and relevance – in what is taught.
Without a doubt, our society will have more opportunities to progress if its
members know more and if they are better trained, and it is the public university
and autonomously the one who must make that contribution. Therefore, we consider
fundamental importance of having an elementary technological device
as a comprehensive plan to confirm the course adopted in each of its
actions, to grow with inclusion, solidarity, social commitment of the
science, technology, art, culture, health, environmental care, and
understanding of the strategic importance of university space for the
development of our countries, which is the contemporary challenge of
Latin American Public University, of Argentina and in that context of
our beloved National University of La Plata.

5. SWOT ANALYSIS
In order to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats in the field of Education, various meetings of
institutional discussion. In addition, the changes operated with
regarding the same analysis carried out in the preparation of the EP 2018 -2022.
The analysis achieved is briefly developed below:
 
STRENGTHS
● Consolidation of institutional work spaces within the UNLP
(Presidency, Academic Units, University Colleges and
Dependencies) that make the continuity of policies viable
institutional improvement of all instances, levels,
modalities and areas of training.
● Ability to adapt different work areas to new
scenarios that arose with the COVID -19 pandemic.
● Systematic construction of data and development of diagnoses that
allow us to increasingly know and understand the factors that
can lead to abandonment or interruption of studies in the
different sections of the degree courses.
 
● Existence of entry and inclusion strategies that cover different
needs of a diverse set of applicants, promoting and
strengthening the heterogeneity of profiles among people
entrants to the UNLP.
● Increasing visibility of the different strategies of the UNLP for the
income and inclusion, which allows the number of
people interested in pursuing their studies at our university.
● Implementation of the PRAE (Academic Performance Program and
Egress) since 2018, and consolidation of lines of work articulated with
the Faculties oriented to the access, permanence and graduation of students
students.
● Strong political consensus reached within the UNLP around the
centrality of permanence and exit policies.
● Planned growth of teaching plants, with respect to the
curricular needs and teaching particularities.
● Continuity of development of sustained training programs
continuous teaching, updating the epistemological and
planning transformations in particular work processes
pedagogical skills of each teacher.
● Institutionalization of information and evaluation - external and internal - of
all instances, levels, modalities and areas of training.
● Diversity of the UNLP postgraduate offering in the following senses:
interinst ituality, qualification (specialization, master's and doctorate),
pedagogical option, fields of knowledge (basic, applied sciences,
humans, etc.).
● Consolidation of an interdisciplinary and highly specialized team
in distance education and application of technologies to the processes of
teaching, with recognized experience in teacher training,
Nodocentes, students and management teams in these processes, and
availability of own virtual environments.
● Widespread availability, through the UNLP Library Network
and the Prebi-Sedici repository, of technological resources for and in access
to sources of information relevant to training processes
teacher, nodocente and student.
 
● Articulation with other areas of the UN LP such as the Extension Secretariat,
the Prosecretary of University Welfare and the Disability Commission
in the work of disseminating inclusion and care strategies for
particular situations of vulnerability.
● Wide community demand for new training proposals.
● Interest of public organizations in generating proposals with a partner profile
community next to the University.
● Extensive experience of extension teams in training processes
together with community actors.
● Exponential increase in demand towards the School's offer
University of Trades within the framework of an Education device
Formal Alternative.
 
OPPORTUNITIES
● Community recognition of UNLP as an institution
university of excellence, committed to its environment.
● Maintenance of the State's public investment in the field of
university training as a production promotion strategy
scientific-technological, the integration of the educational system and the improvement of
university educational quality.
● Aspiration of growing sectors of the population, youth and adults, to
access university education as part of their life projects.
● Vacancy areas in undergraduate and postgraduate training, as a result of
processes of growth and transformation of scientific fields -
academic and professional practice.
● Relevance and growing incidence of information technologies and
communication in the democratization of production processes,
circulation and access to knowledge.
● The experience and infrastructure acquired during virtualization
forced withdrawal of classes in the context of the pandemic, which enhanced
and accelerated the implementation of pedagogical innovations that
constitute a new floor of possibilities in the return to
presence.
 
● Progression, in the international context, towards the conceptualization of
“online university” which promotes collaborative work in networks
national and international academics.
● Growing presence of postgraduate programs at the regional level
and international that promote the international links of the
postgraduate offer, both in the diversification of guest teachers
as in the attendance of foreign students.
● The institutionalization of the Training Schools Program
Professional of the Secretariat of University Policies as
strengthening trade training schools within the framework of the
national universities.
● The Diplomas are presented as paths capable of bringing the
UNL P to sectors that normally do not access the degree or undergraduate degree.
● Diplomas offer spaces in which to integrate disciplines in pursuit
to build appropriate profiles for the recipients.
● Diplomas allow the community dimension to be incorporated into the
formation of the UNLP, strengthening essential roles for the neighborhoods
popular, and promoting their recognition.
 
WEAKNESSES
● Fragmented articulation between undergraduate schools and the Units
Academics.
● Insufficiency of articulation strategies with educational systems
jurisdictions that favor joint institutional work,
promoting the growing inclusion of school graduates
public secondary schools in the region to university studies.
● Differences in academic support strategies by
of the different degree Academic Units towards the students, a
once the specific entry stages have been completed.
● Rigid curricular and institutional conditions, which reduce fees
of advancement and graduation in undergraduate and graduate careers, even when
Graduation rates have been improved at both levels.
 
● Incipient pedagogical-didactic innovation processes that have not yet been
allow us to address the complexity of the “student” condition
university x” contemporary x.
● Inadequacy between the quantity already distributed and the necessary complexity
on the teaching floors of the different Academic Units, with
different degrees of impact on undergraduate teaching processes.
● Still incipient growth in distance or distance postgraduate offers
blended training that expand the scope of continuous training.
● Insufficiency in operational use by teaching staff,
of information systems on academic processes and results.
● Sociocultural permanence of symbolic and material barriers that
prevent choosing university as a possible destination and training project
vital for many young people who graduate from Secondary Education Level.
● Persistence of a poor construction of qualitative indicators that
allow monitoring of populations that present interruptions
in their academic careers to know the specific reasons for
interruption/abandonment of higher education.
● Absence of institutionalization of the University School of Trades in
the organizational structure of the University.
● Being a line in development, the generation of Diplomas by the
mechanisms of Ordinance 290/16 present difficulty in articulation
between Faculties, as well as with and within the Presidency itself.
● The lack of an established budget for dictation does not allow
make the Diplomas a permanent offer.
● Lack of clear procedures for recording journeys and their
certification.
 
  
 
THREATS
● Insufficient articulation within the university system based on the
recent institutional diversification due to the incorporation of new
Universities and continuity of the fracture between systems
jurisdictions of higher technical training - professional, artistic,
humanistic, educational and social, and the university, which make difficult the
harmonious formation of the Higher Education Level established in the
Law 26206 of National Education.
● Transformation in the professional imaginaries of the new
generations that impacts the decrease in enrollment in areas of
training with social and scientific-technological relevance.
● Tendency towards overlapping and overflowing between the traditional areas of
“disciplinary” training and research, which gener- ated trans needs
and interdisciplinary that are still difficult to configure, culturally and operationally.
● Persistence of evaluation perspectives as efficiency control, with
dominance of external and homogeneous parameters that do not consider the
diversity of scientific-academic fields and contexts
institutional.
● Technocratic trends and mercantilist logic in the development of

6. STRATEGY SCENARIO IN THE PLAN
In recent years, the UNLP has shown significant evolution in its three
levels of formal education – undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate – and in each of
their structural problems are on the way to solution, showing that the
strategies designed and devices implemented to solve them
they begin to give results. However, certain aspects deserve
special attention to achieve the desired standards.
The UNLP has a varied availability of degree courses, spread across
17 faculties. The Institution has grown in recent years, both in number of
students as well as teachers. It offered, in 2021, 161 bachelor's degrees (132
degree itself and 29 distinctively nominalized
undergraduate) in 125 majors.
If we take the last few years1, we see that in 2004 (from the beginning of the
Strategic Plan) the UNLP had 86,422 students, increasing in the year
2021 to 134,515 undergraduate students. In 2004, 18,679 were admitted
first time (21,475 adding those who were already UNLP students, but
started a new career) and graduated 4,537 g graduadxs, while
In 2021, 29,8852 students entered (35,190 adding those who, already

when the first publication of statistics from this university was made, beyond that in certain cases such as
When official information is available, some reference to previous years is added.
2 If we take these general numbers we see that the 2021 graduation level is 26 students for every 100 entrants
in the same year 20 21 (and 45.60 per 100 entrants 8 years before -2014 - 17,009). Furthermore, we observe that, in
In 2021, 5,305 students were already enrolled in another UNLP degree and chose to change it or, in many cases,
add another career, especially related ones: bachelor's degree and teaching, for example).
The expenditure/income ratio since the beginning of the Strategic Plan in 2004 has gradually and systematically improved.
year by year: in 2004 there were 4,097 graduates and 18,679 pure entrants, with a relationship

being students, they started a career again) and 7,826 graduated
students, with an average real career duration of 8.17 years.
A first analysis involves identifying an increasing behavior in the
2004/2021 period of said indicators that reaches 55.60% in the case
of student enrollment, 60.00% in the total number of
entrants and 71.03% in the number of graduates.
Analyzing some initial indicators of academic performance, of the
134,515 total UNLP students, 99,325 are re-enrolled (that is,
have already gone through their first year) and are active (taking, passing courses
and exams). Of the re-enrolled students, 49.26% do not pass

the end or accredit the promotion), considered the requirement to sustain your
regularity condition within the framework of the LES. These are 48,933 students
that go at a rate lower than the minimum required, or discontinuous throughout
his student career, although behavior is disparate in the 17
faculties.
This indicates a line of institutional effort that is being pursued.
working and progressing, but in which we must continue to intervene with
emphasis until these standards acquire other proportions.
There is also significant growth in the teaching staff of the
faculties in the period, going from 1 0,360 in 2005 to 14,809 in
February 2022, which represented 42.9% growth3.
The gross global ratio in 2022 was 9.08 students per teacher,
proportion that is considered very fair in auxiliaries and sufficient in
teachers, since taking the ranges established by the CIN, the relationship
average theoretical is 35 students per assistant (10,507 assistants at UNLP,
which means 45 students per assistant) and 120 students per teacher4
(4,302 teachers at UNLP, which shows 110 students per teacher),
taking into account that the average number of subjects taken per number of
                                                 
3 The staff in 2003 was 9,187 teachers in the Faculties, so its growth referring to that year was
of 51.11%.
4 According to the ranges established by the CIN in the ratio of students per assistant, according to the type of
subject and its theoretical or practical load, the chairs can be classified into 4 types: A 15, B 25, C 35 and D 120 students
by assistant.
 
students in a school year is 3.55. However, despite having
achieved adequate teacher/student ratio averages, there remains a whole
work to be done to achieve the internal balances between chairs6 and even
careers that far exceed these indices in teachers and/or
auxiliaries, with others with insufficiencies and legitimate needs.
Without a doubt, the general objective of this university in teaching
university degree is to achieve widespread access to it,
seeking equal opportunities, safeguarding the quality of the
knowledge imparted in the conscience that teaching how to learn is more
It is important that the information that is circumstantially provided to the
student, aspiring to excellence and ensuring relevance and
relevance of them, not only for professional training, but for the
better formation of free citizens endowed with the values
fundamental for a life in democracy.
Along these lines, specific academic objectives are essential, the strategies
of entry, permanence and exit, and are fundamental tools, the
articulation of training between the secondary cycle and undergraduate training,
teacher training, innovative practices, supports and
technologies for information and training, custody of quality
institutional and teaching with own and external evaluations and the
initial follow-up of our graduates, providing them with advice and
opportunities to enter the workforce.
To promote massive income, we seek to define policies that seek
overcome symbolic barriers to position the UNLP as a destination
possible in the imagination of all sectors of the region, articulating the
diversity of existing support devices.
Along these lines, a dissemination program called Come to the
University (to which a specific program is added in the region
called The University goes to school), which spreads the careers of the
                                                 
5 In 2021, students took 348,106 subjects per final exam or promotion, an average of 3.50
subjects taken per re-enrolled student (99,325) and 2.59 subjects taken per student, including
entrants (134,515).
6 Some 3,100 undergraduate professorships operate at the UNLP. Approximately 2,000 are taught in the first quarter
and 2,000 in the second that adds annual and quarterly subjects. In the first quarter of 2020, the
coronavirus pandemic led to the imposition of Social, Preventive and Mandatory Isolation, which made more than 97%
of the chairs circumstantially adopted the distance modality with singular success.

They carry out general dissemination talks annually at the Expo -University of
La Plata (and other Expos organized by municipalities or entities not
governments of the province of Buenos Aires and the rest of the country), with the
attendance of thousands of interested parties. Talks are held at the request of each
college at the University itself, which they attend annually
in person the last divisions of each public school in the region (about
100 schools), in these activities doubts are clarified and material is distributed, and
This material is visited or sent to other public schools in the Province and
various regions of the country. This work proved productive and successful,
although the levels of incorporation of students from public schools
should grow much more7 and their outstanding averages
with some difficulty in accessing higher education, should be
especially recognized and encouraged to start and continue them.
In line with the policies of articulation with the Secondary Education level,
A free in-person support and guidance program was launched
and remotely, with materials produced by the UNLP itself, aimed at the last
year of the Level and the first year of the university in basic subjects
(mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and reading and comprehension practices
of academic texts) that is constantly growing with thousands of students.
While the total number of registered in 2016 was 1,164 young people, in 2019
It rose to 2,850 for both Levels.
Coordination experiences were also developed with schools
secondary schools in the province of Buenos Aires to improve training
teacher and the identification of the basic contents necessary for a
best university performance. It is planned to expand these programs,
taking them to non-university classroom spaces in the region, close to the
places of origin of potential entrants, including the s
establishments of the Secondary Education Level from which they come.

state public, 14,408 (39.83%) from the private sector and 1,343 (3.7%) do not record data.
 
Between 2017 and 2021, the NEXOS program was implemented with financing from
the Secretariat of University Policies (SPU), from which
developed activities to strengthen competencies linked to
access to the university, production of materials and teacher training, in
schools in peripheral and vulnerable areas defined jointly with
the Directorate of Secondary Education of the Province. It is planned to continue and
deepen these and other initiatives within the framework of the new program
“Let's continue studying” to be implemented with financing from the SPU starting
of 2022.
To complete the income support programs, it began in 2012
a free vocational orientation and reorientation course with modality
in person or remotely, which was added to the Faculty's existing program
of Psychology from the UNLP.
To support the permanence of students at the university and combat
desertion, even that which occurs early due to good
job offers and promote graduation, was launched in 2018
the PRAE (Academic Performance and Graduation Program) that we support and
we strengthen.
This program promotes a series of devices with sensors with the
faculties according to their characteristics, needs and possibilities. By

downloading content from the final exam, intensive courses or workshops

others. At the same time, new impetus has been given to the decision to re -
teach complete subjects “against the semester” that several faculties already
they were implementing. On the other hand, the strategies have been deepened

Also within the framework of the RESP, the implementation of
tutoring programs in the faculties, which has a track record
specific to each academic unit and also with that of the program
national tutoring program (PACENI) developed a few years ago. A part
Very significant of these programs are the tutorials that, in the first year
of the careers, they try to address various difficulties in adapting to the
university life that the entrants present and that aim to promote
retention in that initial section. For this same section and in particular for
intermediate routes, there are also specific tutorials or workshops for

CeSPI (Superior Center for Computer Processing), builds and
systematizes different types of information and indicators that are made available

situations and the consequent design of permanence and exit policies.
In addition, the Basic University Cycle Certificate –CBU- was implemented,
valid for all faculties and careers, which promotes the
recognition of the trajectory of basic university training, with a
exclusively academic nature and 1,200 hours of academic activities
approved, with the intention of encouraging advancement in the career with stages

the labor field with respect to the secondary degree.
To deepen these strategies aimed at permanence in the degree,
It is being evaluated to promote that all subjects have the alternative of
be tested by final exam or promotion (today it is an alternative
established in most faculties, but there is a section left
travel to reach totality).
As far as graduation promotion is concerned, as a result of the special
attention provided, which included the specific budget for the PRAE, it was achieved
an exit/income ratio (first-time enrollees) that is close to
40%, much higher than the national average and the UNLP's own ratio
fifteen years before (23%).
Despite the progress made in recent years in the number of graduates,
A greater development of actions is required to achieve in the
next stage a real ratio of at least 50 graduates every 100
pure entrants, being necessary, consequently, a greater
academic performance.
To address the socioeconomic causes and from the creation of a
specific area, the faculties developed programs to disseminate the
university services aimed at that segment and scholarship programs

months, of publication on the Web of the notes and the necessary bibliography.
We already mentioned the devices put in place to address the causes

In these years the problems of improving graduation and consequently the
academic performance with firm maintenance of the required quality and
provided, was installed in each faculty as a policy priority
unavoidable and priority academics.
 
Based on the efficient and coordinated operation of the current programs
of entry, trajectory and exit, a change is seen in the future with respect to
the income/expenditure relationship and, therefore, with respect to the variables that
should be treated to promote systematic growth in discharge (in
the year 2017 – the year before the implementation of the PRAE - the students
284,643 subjects were approved. Four years later, in 2021, they approved
325,264 subjects).
The connection with recent graduates, for its part, has an important
and solid development that is intended to continue. The relevant area, from the

all those who process their title and follow up for six
years – a year, surveying their labor insertion and at 5 or 6 years, when

university in the balance of his career and the eventual difficulties and
progress in their insertion and job security.

of the graduate with the UNLP, trains him for the job search and also
develops a database that today brings together 69,507 resumes of
graduates and students (49,807 CVs updated as of December 2019),
forms search networks and institutional links and resolved the exit
employment of some 112 recent graduates in 2019. Progress is being made in
systematic link with the State in the selection and provision of
professionals trained according to their demands, beyond those
coming from the private sector.
Regarding the fundamental tools to sustain this process of
inclusion, teacher training at the UNLP has several lines of
work that involves thousands of teachers and assistants.
In 2006, the Specialization in University Teaching was created as
free postgraduate course taken by hundreds of teachers from all
faculties of the UNLP and in which they project and implement innovations and
pedagogical research on university training, which has
has been having a concrete impact on a continuous renewal of the
forms of teaching in our University, which is projected not only to
 
the students, but to their professorships to which they belong, multiplying their effects

Within this framework, the academic journal has been published since 2015

experiences and knowledge, in which, in addition to experts in the field of
higher education teachers and professors from the UNLP participate, promoting

These policies are continuously articulated with the teacher union through

of the continuous delivery of seminars, workshops and training courses

This previous trajectory of technological development and devices of
Training was the floor from which, at the beginning of the pandemic in
March 2020, it was possible to make a rapid quantitative and qualitative leap in the use
of ICT to support all undergraduate, graduate and
postgraduate in virtual mode. Only during 2020 were created in the entire field
of the UNLP a total of 4,832 classrooms in virtual environments, where they participated
106,257 students and 16,935 teachers. They also multiplied
training instances, launching, as already said, a wide
battery of asynchronous distance courses, synchronous webinar meetings,
workshops, tutorials and guides, and permanent personalized assistance to
teachers, nodocentes and management teams.
 
The external evaluation of institutional and academic quality by the
CONEAU peer evaluators, is a meticulous process that includes a
initial self-assessment, the development of an institutional project and the
review of the study plans9, among other guidelines, which they have already gone through
the University itself (it has already completed its second institutional evaluation by
external peers) and 12 of the 17 faculties - with 37 undergraduate courses
accredited, some several times -.
Of the total degree programs accredited at the university, 24 (65%) are
for 6 years and 13 (35%) for 3 years. After the different phases of
accreditation, the courses receive additional financial support for the
compliance with possible recommendations for the improvement of
quality, through the national projects currently in force
improvement of teaching PROMEI, PROMAGRO, PROMVET, PROMFYB,
PROMARQ, PROMED, PROMOD, PROQUIM, PROMINF, PMG and PMP, and
teaching support for careers not yet accredited, such as the one mentioned

On the other hand, the modification of the national Education regulations

The University legitimizes the development of different postgraduate careers and is
developing content for undergraduate courses. In fact, since the year
In 2019, the UNLP has validation via CONEAU of its SIED -UNLP (System

It is necessary to continue promoting joint efforts of the Faculties to
the generation of new careers with training proposals
interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary that respond to new challenges
social, environmental, cultural, technological, economic and political,
required in the development process of our Community, linking
chairs of different disciplines and using, depending on the case, subjects that

are already dictated. In this sense, there is the successful precedent of the
Computer Engineering degree, launched in 2010,
dictated, as stated, jointly by the Faculties of Informatics and
Engineering.
Other careers created in recent years in response to demands
diverse and/or based on the identification of vacancy areas,
implemented by initiatives of each faculty such as the Bachelor's Degree in
Nutrition and the Technique in Cardiological Practices started in 2013
(adding to the Bachelor's Degree in Obstetrics) and the implementation
in the free, public and free teaching of Nursing Techniques in
2016, at the Faculty of Medical Sciences. As well as the Techniques in
Sports Journalism, in Popular Communication, in Digital Communication and
in Public Communication and Politics from the Faculty of Journalism and
Social Communication, the Portuguese Teaching Staff of the Faculty of
Humanities and Educational Sciences, administration techniques
and Management of Purebred Racing Horse Haras (taught in San
Antonio de Areco term) and in Agricultural Production (in joint
with our Inchausti School) of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, and the
Technician and Bachelor's Degree in Meteorology taught by the Faculty of
Astronomical and Geophysical Sciences, all of recent implementation.
Also added are the creation of the University Technician in Assistance
Dentistry and Dental Laboratory Prosthetics, both of the
Faculty of Dentistry, the recent approval of the Technician
University in Therapeutic Support from the Faculty of Psychology,
the ICT Analyst career at the Faculty of Informatics, Technical Studies
in Popular Music and in Sound and Recording from the Faculty of Arts, the
Technician in Community Risk Management and Bachelor's Degree in
Speech Therapy of the Faculty of Social Work and the University Technician
in Agroecology from the Faculty of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences.
The introduction into the study plans of
optional subjects that allow flexibility and diversity to the
individual training and a growing academic dynamic that facilitates
transversal mobility of students, recognizing knowledge
acquired if students decide to change careers.
 
Guaranteeing training with a gender perspective at all levels is
also a challenge that faces us in the current scenario and that our
university has explicitly assumed. This requires continuing to go deeper
transversal policies and curricular innovations that ensure progress
growing around this central objective.
A singular and complex line is the articulation of the careers linked to
Health sciences among themselves and with provincial public institutions and
municipalities with different levels of complexity that operate in the region.
There are several degree programs taught in various Units.
UNLP academics linked to the topic (about 15): Medicine, Dentistry
and its techniques, Psychology, Nursing, Obstetrics, Nutrition, Practices
Cardiology, Pharmacy, Biochemistry, Optometry, Therapeutic companion,
Social Work, in addition to specific postgraduate courses, research institutes
and university institutions such as the Medicines Production Unit
and the Dental University Hospital.
For its part, in addition to the enormous public offer of primary care in the
health center that operates in the region (about 70 primary care centers in
Berisso, Ensenad a and La Plata), La Plata, as the Capital city of the province
of Buenos Aires, concentrates a group of Public Hospitals of High
Complexity (7), which also function as network referral centers
of provincial and municipal public hospitals in the rest of the Province.
It is necessary to highlight the “Gral” Polyclinic Interzonal Acute Hospital. Saint
Martín”, to the Interzonal Acute Hospital “San Juan de Tórax Institute”.
God”, to the Acute and Chronic Neuropsychiatric Hospital “Alejandro Korn”
(Melchor Romero), to the “San Roque” Interzonal Acute Hospital in Gonnet,
to the “Ricardo Gutiérrez” Acute Maternal and Child Hospital, to the Hospital
Acute General “Rodolfo Rossi”, to the Interzonal Acute Children's Hospital
specialized in Pediatrics “Sor María Ludovica”.
In addition, there are a series of specialized regional hospitals such as
Noel Sbarra Zonal Hospital (former Casa Cuna) specialized in pediatrics or the
Zonal Dental Hospital specialized in children Adolfo Bollini or the
El Dique specialized chronic chronic hospital in Ensenada or the experience
unique in the region of the UPA 24 6 Prompt Care Unit of Los Hornos
and other Zonal Hospitals such as the Horacio Cestino of Ensenada, the Mariano
 
Larrain de Berisso, the Elina de La Serna de La Plata (subzonal) specialized
in pediatrics, the Interzonal Hospital Specialized in Toxicology and Health
Mental (former Reencuentro) specialized in drug addictions and
alcoholism, among others.
Several of these hospitals, among many others, have a connection
historic with the medical residencies of our graduates and one more
recent with the Compulsory Final Practice of the Medicine degree. In fact,
numerous chairs operate within its scope and in the case of the Polyclinic, the
magnitude of the experience, which also added the dictation of the Career of
the Bachelor of Obstetrics, had the UNLP build a building
specific on the property for teaching classes and teachers' offices and
teachers. The same at the El Dique Hospital, recovering a Pavilion
entire for the Dictation of Nursing and Companion Techniques
Therapeutic.
However, and even adding the natural wealth of these antecedents in the
historical solidarity operation, the experience is far from being a network
articulated inside and outside the UNLP that strengthens research and
undergraduate and postgraduate training process of our students and collaborate
with all the potential of the UNLP with the optimization of care, the
operation in general, the production of medicines and the enormous
potential of a joint development process of the UNLP with institutions
publics focused on the health of the population in all its dimensions and
aspects, particularly of our region and the province of Buenos Aires.
At the UNLP, postgraduate training was established at the beginning of the
2022 by 247 degrees -31 doctorates (13%), 72 master's degrees (29%) and 144
specializations (58%) - and about 500 refresher courses. 95.0% of the
courses is accredited (224) or in the process of accreditation (10) in the
CONEAU, a process that still remains to be concluded (there are 17 races left without
accreditation: 14 created in 2021 without even the opportunity to present themselves
CONEAU) and 3 were withdrawn.
Regarding their national validation, 9 1% corresponds to
validated races (190), 5 races are in a position to be validated and 15
they are in process.
 
Regarding the modality, 221 races are in-person and 26 are remote. 194
are validated and 30 are in the validation process.
Enrollment in Postgraduate courses increased by 243% in recent years
sixteen years, going from 5,024 students in 2006 to 17,235 in the
beginning of 2022. To these we must add the attendees to the training courses
update, which exceeded 13,000 in 2021.
To complement these courses, it is promoted through an ordinance, the
dictation of postgraduate programs that, although they do not reach the rank of
career, will allow the courses to be systematized with a certain workload and
complexity.
In the period (2006 -2022), entrants increased by 50%, going from
1,208 to 1,813 and graduates 20% going from 248 to 298, with a relationship
of 16 graduates for every 100 entrants by 2022.
In December 2021, the UNLP had 2,778 teachers with
approved doctorate, 444 with a master's degree and 645 with a bachelor's degree
specialization –total: 3.86710 (satisfactory growth figure since it had
918 doctors in 2008, the year in which the Statute was reformed and
guaranteed free doctorates for U NLP teachers) -.
However, it is of fundamental importance to maintain the marking
growth of that figure, especially in research teachers, having
take into account that, in 2022, 5,259 are categorized, of which 2,537 are
active in the Research Incentives Program. In 2022, 73% of
The categorized research teachers have a postgraduate degree and the
53% are doctors, the latter exceeding the total number of
active researchers in the Incentive Program.
Thus, the promotion of graduation in general from postgraduate courses,
not only to achieve desirable values for the development of the UNLP, but
for the need to provide our graduates with the best elements
for his professional performance, he is transformed in this period into a
fundamental objective in the subject. For this, courses were launched
free research methodology and thesis preparation for
students of postgraduate courses and other stimulus measures such as a

No-teachers 97 are Doctors, 3 are Masters and 5 are Specialists.
 
subsidy to the Academic Unit for thesis defended since 2011,
additional to the amount granted to all powers to guarantee the
free doctorates for teachers; also incorporated the
publication of the summaries of the doctoral and master's theses in a new version
electronic and/or in paper version.
Additionally, in 2022 we are incorporating a scholarship program for
teachers and nonocentes of the UNLP who aspire to follow any career in
postgraduate course with the aim of guaranteeing absolute gratuity for
their teachers and nonteachers.
Another objective is the promotion of theses in master's and doctoral degrees and theses
in specializations, oriented to specific topics that solve problems
linked to the productive, social, environmental and public sector environment, which
encourage and allow the connection of the graduate with the various sectors
extra-university and contribute to national and regional processes of
sustainable development.
Aiming to provide the UNLP with the various tools to sustain the
growth in the quaternary and continuous training of the graduate, was adapted
the portal with all the necessary information for an applicant in three languages
–Spanish, Portuguese and English - and the virtual provision service is consolidated
bibliography provided by PREBI as part of LibLink –ISTEC.
The Summer School is also a space for teacher exchange
and researchers from various disciplines who come together in the classroom and
distance and propose discussion on specific topics, enriching the
dialogue of knowledge between the members of the same institutions of the
UNLP and other participants. The virtual modality multiplied the attendance of
foreigners. The last edition took place in February 2022 and included
an offer of 9 courses with more than 300 enrolled students, coming from
our University, as well as other National Universities and the
foreign. Audiovisual material is produced that recovers the testimony of
Summer School teachers and the experience of career graduates
postgraduate program at UNLP whose results have an impact on the community
academically and in different sectors of the community in general.
To help alleviate the difficulties in forming the juries of
thesis (and the difficulties caused by the pandemic) were provided to all
 
powers and to the Presidency itself of teleconferencing devices in
Internet and the necessary legal framework so that the thesis defense can
be done virtually, totally or partially.
Given the intense and permanent growth of postgraduate training, which
requires an occupation of spaces that often overlaps with the
demanded by degree training, it was necessary to provide the UNLP with
common-use infrastructure for all its postgraduate courses, with facilities
appropriate and available to all faculties. In this line, in the
second half of 2016 the Postgraduate Center began to operate
in the Sergio Karakachoff Building located on Calle 48 e/6 y 7, which has
60 classrooms and 4 fully equipped auditoriums, with a capacity of 2,000
simultaneous attendees. This Center is available to all
academic units for free. In the second half of 2019
we added an adjacent Convention Center with 18 equipped rooms
with capacity for another 2,000 people.
During 2021, among postgraduate courses and seminars,
book presentations, conferences, videoconferences, congresses and
days, 857 academic activities with an average of 3,800
weekly participants (43 weeks) and 28,687 hours/classroom. Between these
activities, 23 were conferences and 127 postgraduate courses from different
faculties of the UNLP. The activity grows exponentially. Until the
At the moment (March 2022) spaces have been reserved for the realization of 2 1
conferences in the semester and numerous activities such as those mentioned.
There are already 26 distance postgraduate courses with approval from the Council
Superior of the faculties of Computer Science, Psychology, Legal Sciences and
Social, Humanities and Educational Sciences, Social Work, Journalism
and Social Communication, and Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, of which nine
are accredited, four in the accreditation process and one not
accredited by CONEAU (other initiatives are advancing that include other
Academic Units). Several of these careers were created in the
context of the subsidy program for the creation of distance courses
offered by the Presidency of the UNLP. The remote modality for
Postgraduate training is advancing very strongly: 9 of the last 14
races presented to the Superior Council, were remote. Despite the
 
strong advances in the subject, there is still room to grow in the postgraduate offer to
distance to reach more graduates and in a greater articulation of
contents and approaches between specializations, master's degrees and doctorates
own and with other universities in the country and abroad, particularly
the region.
During the months of June to September 2019, the 6th School was held
Virtual International CAVIL A (Latin American Virtual Campus) with a total
of 193 users enrolled in 5 UNLP courses. The Virtual School
International CAVILA is made up of a series of courses offered by
the highly prestigious Ibero-American Universities that make up AULA
(Association of Latin American Universities).
The development of the first experience of
COOL (Course Open Online Learning), where we worked with teachers of
different parts of the world in three online courses, with a total of 247
approved.
Since 2019, some proposals that arose from lawsuits were activated
specific to the faculties. One of them is the formation of the Bank of
Evaluators of AUGM (Association of Universities of the Montevideo Group)
that allows our graduates to participate in different activities of
postgraduate evaluation in the region (thesis defenses, projects, management,
etc.).
Also within the framework of AUGM we promote the virtual mobility of
postgraduate degree, which resulted in places offered by our University
(courses to which foreigners joined) to promote research of
the UNLP in the region.
The postgraduate academic offer is rich and comparatively abundant
in Doctorates and Masters, mostly requested by teachers
researchers, but still insufficient in Specializations (despite the fact that
constitute 58% of our offer), demanded by our graduates
oriented to external professions that today take current courses,
but they require a career for this purpose. Therefore, the incorporation is promoted
of new Specializations for graduates to update and specialize
certain knowledge, necessary to reaffirm or multiply their
own skills in the world of work.
 
Undergraduate teaching at UNLP is of recognized quality and is
teaches in 5 experimental, innovative and reference schools for everything
the education system. One of initial and primary education - the School
Graduated “Joaquín V. González” - and four secondary schools: the National School
“Rafael Hernández”, the “Víctor Mercante” Lyceum, the Baccalaureate of Fine Arts
“Prof. Francisco A. De Santo” and the “María” School of Agriculture and Livestock
Cruz and Manuel L. Inchausti”.
General enrollment is 4,930 students and remains stable in those
ranks over the years since it has a lottery entry system
and the number of teachers is about 470 (plus 8,500 teaching hours), with a
average ratio of 10 students per teacher (without considering the hours
chair), without major differences between the establishments.
Since 2014, statistical studies have been developed and consolidated
on student trajectories in undergraduate colleges focused
in admission, permanence and discharge. Although the number of vacancies for
entering secondary schools is the same every year, tuition
totals show a slight growth until 2016 and then
stabilize, which would indicate greater retention with an increase
overall tuition by 1%.
This variation in the retention rate is due to the impact they have had
the Programs to Strengthen Academic Trajectories which,
based on the recognition of students as subjects of law,
guarantee access, school continuity and graduation, as well as the
pedagogical, material and linking conditions that make the trajectory
for the school.
Inclusion with quality implies addressing the diversity that income generates
by lottery through educational policies that contemplate the multiple and
specific permanence and exit strategies. In this sense, when analyzing
repetition for the 2019 academic year, it is observed that the School
Graduated does not present cases of repetition and has a level of
shelling less than 1%. For their part, secondary schools have
a global repetition rate of 6% and an approximate breakdown by
25% cohort.
 
Having optimized entry to schools with the electronic lottery, it is
necessary to continue advancing in mechanisms that guarantee the
democratization of access. In this sense, the Undergraduate Prosecretariat
coordinates with secondary schools the implementation of a set
increasing number of devices that aim at the accreditation of trajectories
incomplete, for current students of different years and also for
non-graduate graduates.
A critical historical problem of the Colleges was their building situation and it was
resolved in recent years. It began with the total recovery of the Lyceum
“Víctor Mercante” in 2006, which was unoccupied and very deteriorated,
process that ended in 2015, its current state being optimal;
continued with the general restoration of the National School in 2008, which
It was fenced due to the risk of its cornices collapsing; and with the construction
of a new building for the Baccalaureate of Fine Arts inaugurated in the
beginning of the 2013 school year.
In addition, a series of important works were carried out: at the School
Graduated, with the painting and full value, the total reconstruction
of the patios, the gym, the toilets of the students of the garden and the
primary and the parking lot asphalt; at the Lyceum with the recovery of
the perimeter walls, the interior patios, the carpentry – in
particular the windows and the external paint of the building -, of the floors of
pinotes of its classrooms, the Multipurpose Room and the construction of the Buffet
and central heating by radiators; at the National School with its
carpentry, its patios and exteriors, the total restoration of its living room
events, the new dining room and library buildings and the recovery of
its laboratories; in the Baccalaureate of Fine Arts, with the construction of a
floor most dedicated entirely to music, with classrooms and cabinets completely
soundproofed, which allowed part of the activities to be incorporated into the building
that were held in an annex and with the brand new construction of its hall
audience. Finally, at the “María Cruz y Livestock” School of Agriculture and Livestock
Manuel L. Inchausti” hydraulic and improvement works were carried out and
completed the definitive asphalt work for its access, which guarantees
definitely the passability of the 10 km of dirt road that
separates the Inchausti Agrarian School from the asphalt that reaches Estación Valdés
 
(today in management of new repairs due to the permanent transit of
trucks and heavy machinery). A series of works were also carried out
expansion and adaptation of facilities with the purpose that the
students of the School had the possibility of spending time
complete, which has been reflected in the increase in the amount of
female students in the establishment. Likewise, spaces were expanded
to optimize the health care of students and workers and
built an internal vehicular bridge that significantly improves the
connectivity of the fundamental sectors of the field.
It remains to complete the Baccalaureate master plan with classrooms, workshops and offices
administrative over its new auditorium, and build service workshops
for the National College.
The students of the Schools were also incorporated as users of the
University Dining Hall, with the same benefits as the rest of the
degree students.
A series of structural processes for the better development of schools
and the quality of the teaching they provide, they are underway and advanced
or completed, such as the national validation of their study plans (first
experience in the country) and qualifications from the Ministry of Education
Based on the changes carried out in recent years, the implementation
of the teaching career that requires systematic and permanent evaluation,
the total regularization of its teaching staff through the competition system -with
evaluations every four years -, and the completion of updating your
general regulations by the CEMyP (Council of Secondary Education and
Primary).
Joint work between the
schools and CeSPI to improve the quality of information
provided by the Kimkelén system with the objective of defining indicators and
reports that allow having updated and consistent information for
the design and evaluation of educational policies by the teams of
management.
In relation to teacher training, the criterion is adopted that which
strengthen and prioritize training linked to teaching practices and
school links in the undergraduate system through workshops and courses
 
of updating, Postgraduate Seminars and Agreements with the Faculty of
Humanities and Educational Sciences that guarantee the free offer of
Specializations for undergraduate teachers.
Retention and containment programs, articulation between cycles
primary, secondary and degree, extension and promotion of the
school coexistence, function satisfactorily and progress was made in the
updating the regulations or ordinances that have been left
disjointed with the advances of the new status.
The participation of teachers and students of the Undergraduate system was incorporated
in extension activities (the Schools intervene as units
executing agencies in extension projects approved and financed from the
2007). And in that line, the beginning of educational research of
teachers from schools with specific programs that consider their
particularity, underpinning the quality of teaching and the definition of
necessary standards of knowledge for the smooth transit of
secondary to undergraduate university training.
In addition, the Specific Preparation for teachers of the
Graduate School, whose second cohort began in 2013 and from that
year, initial and primary education teachers from the Graduate School of the
UNLP that passed the Specific Preparation can access master's degrees
and specializations of the Faculty of Humanities and Educational Sciences
providing the possibility of feedback between the teaching of
Postgraduate and Undergraduate in the university environment itself.
Since 2011, schools have participated in the National Conectar Program
Equality, dependent on the Ministry of Education of the Nation, which is
vital importance to develop application strategies and
experimentation in the use of ICTs in the classroom. As part of these
activities, progress was made in the publication of electronic books (the Colleges
participate in UNLP calls for the publication of books
academic electronics) thus contributing to making it easier for students to access
free basic study materials.
An experimental articulation program began to be developed with the
grade level for final year students, promoting a system of
inter-school electives, with a strong relationship with the fields of knowledge
 
linked to the careers of the Academic Units that promote and facilitate
the effective continuation of the training process.
In 2012, the Observatory of School Coexistence Practices was created
(OPCE), in order to constitute a field of research and
development of policies for articulating coexistence between schools of
the UNLP, which accounts for the need to think about education from a
comprehensive perspective, in which teaching and learning for a
Democratic coexistence are fundamental. The OPCE gave way to the creation
of the Directorate of Educational Inclusion in 2014, which organizes its
activities in two axes: an academic axis and another that addresses the issues
referring to subjectivity and school ties. Within this last
axis, the consolidation of inter-institutional work in the definition
of intervention strategies in situations of subjective emergencies, in the
implementation of the Comprehensive Sexual Education Law and the
Articulation and institutional integration in Physical Education for the third year
From high school.
It was also launched in a closed cycle and on an experimental basis, the
taught in the afternoon shift of a Bachelor's degree in Sanitation and Management
Environmental between the National College and the Faculty of Engineering, prioritizing
to the sectors with the most difficulties in accessing formal education. Us
We propose that each UNLP secondary school have a neighborhood annex
for the delivery of a baccalaureate that follows the same criteria.
Also in 2010, the University School of Trades began operating
(EUO), designed based on training paths of increasing complexity.
The School begins its action in clubs, CCEU and organizations in the territory and
He completes his third level in the classrooms of different faculties. To the teacher of
Each job is accompanied by a tutor who is attentive to the
needs of young people who mostly went through different
educational spaces with serious difficulties in sustaining the processes. The
activities are articulated with the Ministry of Education of the Nation for the
accreditation of a set of training paths. The Program has
the contribution of the Federation of Cultural and Sports Institutions and the
Florencio Pérez Foundation, which allows each graduate to count in the end
of their training, with a kit of tools necessary to exercise it.
 
During 2019 there were a total of 2,736 pre-registered, of which were
766 were selected and a total of 545 students graduated. Of them 35.94%
They are women and 64.05% are men.
In 2020, the EUO had 6,413 registered, of which 2,359 responded
to its target population in terms of inclusive policy, being able to offer the
Possibility of joining the courses for 884 interested parties. Before the
pandemic and the circumstances that it imposed, the decision was made to
give a response to those who had enrolled in the courses and assume the
challenge of offering a modality in virtual environments in accordance with the
access possibilities for our students. The proposal was virtualized
training implementing 16 courses through meetings with people
students in WhatsApp groups centrally, and Facebook groups to a lesser extent
extent. In these “new classrooms” the students were approached with tokens
educational, along with a constant exchange of materials (videos, audios,
texts), between teachers, tutors and students, being able to maintain a bond
pedagogical with them. Once this instance is approved, the students
carried out the corresponding professional practices, when the
health context allowed it.
In 2021, the EUO decides to develop, faced with a massive enrollment of more
of 43,000 people, the digitalization of their training proposals for their
remote boarding. In this way the school is currently
offering two Training Programs and modalities: the Program
Inclusive Vocational Training, which incorporated 1,783 students who
During the year 2020 and 2021, they completed the theoretical section and in a scheme
gradually carry out professional practices to obtain their certification of
competencies; and the Open Access Program for Training
Professional, through which they were linked to a platform
self-administered with support in Web Classrooms 15,000 people of which
8,140 completed the first level of training, certifying only the
theoretical knowledge of the chosen profession.
Likewise, during this period a modality of Education was inaugurated
Distance within the framework of agreements with municipalities and organizations of the
civil society for the delivery of the University Instructor in Education
 
Professional Technician which had a hundred graduates and the
Personal Assistant for people with disabilities.
Since its inception, the EUO has trained a total of 4,174 graduates through
228 face-to-face trade courses linked to the families of
activity in the construction, metalworking, gastronomy,
care of people, graphics, services to third parties, clothing, computing,
wood and furniture, automotive mechanics, health and forestry; ha
granted the certification of theoretical knowledge to more than 8,000 people
through the Open Access Program and to more than 100 people in the
distance mode.
During 2021, the Secretariat of University Policies approved, within the framework
of the "University Program of Professional Education Schools", a
proposal presented that aims to promote instances of education
competitive and updated professionals, focused on dynamic sectors
and projection in the region, such as: welding, mechanics, care of
people and computing, proposed by the call and validated by the
regional productive dynamics. Based on this proposal, we will study
also the productive and market environment, and depending on the
characteristics and demands that arise from there, 5 more courses will be developed,
along with building adaptation and equipment for the development of the
themselves.
As a substantive policy, the
Labor Connection Program for graduates of the University School
of Trades, a device for accompaniment, guidance, support and
training for the labor inclusion of our graduates, with actions
diagnosis, task plan and specific training workshops for
microentrepreneurs and self-managed workers, reconnecting with
more than 1,800 graduates who went through the device, in the conviction of
that the commitment does not end with the delivery of the certificate of the person who ends
each course. In this framework, a Service Center has been operating since 2018.
in which graduates carry out paid professional practices and
supervised. Services are provided such as maintenance of green spaces,
masonry, institutional cleaning, as well as furniture and/or manufacturing
blacksmith products intended for the different departments of the
 
University. So far there are 40 works completed and 93 graduates
hired
It is important to highlight that among the works mentioned is the
making furniture for the rooms of the University Hotel,
work that was carried out entirely in a complex healthcare context,
complying beyond this with the agreed deadlines. According to
statistics of the EUO Job Linkage and Insertion Program a
44% of graduates improved their employability status.
The EUO in coordination with the Public Policy Management Directorate,
also held a specific line for program holders
social. In this line they accompanied each other from 2011 to 2018,
training, support and technical assistance processes for
which more than 500 holders of the Social Income Program traveled with
Work dependent on the Ministry of Social Development of the Nation. TO
Through the agreement, job training activities were carried out,
associative and productive strengthening in areas linked to blacksmithing,
masonry, painting, maintenance of green spaces, specifying in its
practical training, works necessary for the university itself and a
unprecedented experience in the country: the implementation of a permanent
training for work and trades, consolidating the figure of
Diploma created by the UNLP from the first management experience
that the university launched.
Starting in 2018, with the creation of the “We Make the Future Program” from the
Directorate of Public Policy Management, a program was launched
of accompaniment and strengthening of the situation of the holders
linked to the UNLP. Access to information; procedures in case of
suspensions; comprehensive training courses and finally the constitution of
a permanent management table with the MDSN. The
experience developing the "Report on the PHF in the La Plata region"
that would be useful both academically and within the framework of
evaluation of public policy by the Ministry and the document
"Contributions of the public university to the challenges of social programs
in the current situation".
 
At the end of 2019, after the announcement of the national program “Argentina Against
Hunger” the document “Contributions of the Prosecretariat of Policies” was prepared
of the UNLP to the design of a national policy against hunger PPS".
The objective was to produce inputs that contribute to the decisions of the State to
the adjustment of the specific policy in real time and in this sense it has been
worked during 2020 and 2021.
In the context of the pandemic, work was done on the dissemination, updating and
advice to holders of social programs linked to the different
programmatic lines of the Prosecretariat, in public policy measures
implemented and in 2021 the evaluation of the Program began
National We Make the Future within the framework of the agreement signed with the Council
National Social Policies and IDB financing.
The objective of the same is to analyze, from a multidimensional perspective
and transversal, the results of the We Make the Future Program; making focus
both in the management characteristics (strengths and learning) and in the
incidence of this in the improvement of the living conditions of its
participants. Evaluation is a tool capable of providing
useful data, both to governments, for planning and updating
effective and timely public policies, as well as citizens in the exercise
of their right to information.
In turn, the result will represent an essential input for planning.
and evaluation of social policies, especially social programs
conditional transfer, considering that said product is made
from an area of the University that has supported design actions,
implementation and evaluation of policies with the Ministry of Labor,
Employment and Social Security; the Ombudsman of the Province of
Buenos Aires; Municipalities of the region; and the Ministry of Social Development of
The Nation (MDSN). In particular, with this last body, the Directorate of
Public Policy Management participated as the executing agency of the Program
Social Income with Work as an Executing Unit between the years
2010 and 2018, so he has extensive experience in the subject that
is reflected in the present process.
In summary, the University School of Trades, after 13 years of
consolidation, bases its strategic guidelines on three components
 
nouns: vocational training in trades and job training
through two training modalities, accompaniment to students
advanced, graduates in the professionalization and specialization of their
internships and employment relationships and the accreditation of knowledge and skills.
In the 2022 school year, the two modalities are being implemented
referred training courses, which have acquired in the last year the
institutionality of training programs: 1) The Inclusive Program for
Vocational Training in which the incorporation of a professional profile is prioritized
sectors with difficulties in accessing rights to face-to-face courses with
certification of competencies, and the 2) Open Access Program to
Vocational training characterized by being a modality
self-administered in the UNLP Web Classrooms virtual environment,
designed by the Distance Education team, teachers and a team
pedagogy of the School, allowing the student to travel a path that
integrates educational sheets, explanatory videos and questionnaires that, as
evaluative validate the learned content.
Linkage, advice and
career guidance for graduates and students coordinated between the Area of
Monitoring and Support for Labor Inclusion and teachers of the
EUO in addition to the Coordination of the Service Center as a space for
continuous professional training and exploration for the design of a
competency accreditation and certification system.
The incorporation of sectors stands out as a priority for this period.
of the community that today are not linked to the public university, from
of formal proposals for training in trades, allowing greater
opportunities for access to public education and job placement for
those sectors
In July 2016, the Superior Council approved the Ordinance that creates the
University Diplomas, an initiative that seeks to establish a
institutional recognition of the training paths offered by the
University outside the degree and postgraduate degree, linked to the field of
university extension and community training. Seeks to deepen the
efforts and strategies that the UNLP has been developing, linked to the
training of different social actors - with special emphasis on
 
most disadvantaged sectors of the community -, through activities
carried out by the Faculties, the Colleges, the School of Trades and the
UNLP Social Council. The proposal highlights the importance of providing
university educational experiences linked to training in trades
and community of a greater hierarchy in terms of its
institutionality and recognition as formative experiences.
Over the years, the offer of these training courses has grown,
both within the presidency and in the different faculties. exist
Diplomas articulated with demands from public organizations,
social organizations, unions, and their diversity and ease of access to
large sectors of the community that do not access other UNLP offers,
present the challenge of consolidating objectives and perspectives, formalizing the
paths and advance in their articulation with others of greater complexity and
articulate with educational completion strategies for all those
sectors that, through these experiences, decide to deepen their
university studies.

5. SWOT ANALYSIS
In order to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats in terms of Investigation, various meetings of
institutional discussion. In addition, the changes operated with
regarding the same analysis carried out in the preparation of the EP 2018 -2022.
The analysis achieved is briefly developed below:
 
STRENGTHS
1. The great participation of teachers-researchers in the Teaching Units
Research (Uls) favors the coordination of activities specific to
each one, the interaction with others, the development of activities
interdisciplinary and access to external funding programs.
2. The management positions of the UIs are filled by competition.
3. System for promoting scientific, technological and research
artistic mature
4. Relationship with Conicet
5. High capacity for generating knowledge in a broad set
of fields and disciplines, and on relevant topics with scope to
local, national and international level.
6. Availability of various promotional instruments and programs
for scientific research and development activities,
technological and artistic, which equitably reach the
faculties.
7. Sustained growth in research activities in all areas
faculties, without quantitative or qualitative distinction in reference to the
trajectories and traditions in the scientific, technological and artistic fields.
 
8. Consolidation of the location of research activities and
development in Institutes, Centers and Laboratories based on the works
carried out in them (replacements, total constructions,
functionalizations).
9. Formalization of numerous Research Units through their
standardization and approval in the Boards of Directors and the Council
Superior.
10. Continuity and consolidation of equipment, lines and programs
nationally and internationally recognized quality research.
11. High proportion of researchers categorized into the different
instances of the Scientific-Technological System, with a distribution
increasingly balanced on the respective scales.
12. Consolidation of the own and associative capacity of the teams of
research to communicate knowledge and developments
scientific, technological and artistic that they generate.
13. Increase in the traditional high volume of communications
scientific, technical, technological and artistic publications published in magazines
specialized with international scope and evaluation.
14. Diversification and strengthening of actions in health policies
training of scientific, technological and artistic researchers, as well as
as well as technicians and collaborators, graduates or not.
15. Sustained growth of the group of researchers graduated in
postgraduate courses.
16. Deepening of the instances of initiation of
undergraduate student research.
17. Sustained increase in economic resources in the area of Science and
Technique.
18. Strong building growth and improvements in infrastructure aimed at
research activities.
 
OPPORTUNITIES
1. Existence of programs to promote Research and
Development, plus the continuity of subsidizing agencies, which provide
extrabudgetary resources.
 
2. Diversity of cooperation possibilities with national organizations
and international, governmental and non-governmental.
3. Growth of systems and knowledge diffusion networks at scale
world.
4. New institutional policies for the promotion of Projects
Technological and Social Development, aimed at promoting the transfer
effective results to the socio-productive environment.
5. New evaluation strategies for researchers, aimed at
improve the valorization of technological development activities,
innovation and artistic, and the transfer of knowledge to the environment
social and productive.
6. Consolidation of national instruments of a single system of
information regarding scientific research activities,
technological and artistic.
 
WEAKNESSES
1. Incipient systematization and standardization of information related to
research activities, which generates insufficiencies in the
construction of useful indicators for decision making.
2. Structural dynamics fundamentally organized by actions and
provisions of external funding and evaluation agencies
complementary.
3. Operational disarticulation of the resource management and
external financing, especially at the international level.
4. Insufficiency in transfer and patenting strategies, with
small quantities recorded.
5. Low proportion of positions with greater dedication are dedicated to
research in relation to the total teaching staff.
6. Need for articulation between the areas of Research and
Administration to overcome instrumental and logical difficulties
confronted from the conceptions of effectiveness, efficiency,
transparency, evaluation and control.
 
THREATS
 
1. Uncertainty regarding the maintenance of the level of increase
general university budget recorded in recent years
and, consequently, the resources allocated to Research.
2. Reduction of the position staff with exclusive dedication to the
research, due to insufficient retention of resources
formed humans.
3. Loss of opportunities to access external financing,
especially at the international level.
4. Reduction in the use of available financing instruments,
by researchers given the complexity of the
administrative and economic-financial procedures.
 
5. THE STRATEGY SCENARIO IN THE PLAN
The development of research is one of the central characteristics and
historical records of the UNLP. In recent years there has been marked progress
in this pillar.
His scientific production can be seen in the SCImago 2021 Ranking,
based on the Scopus database, which evaluates 7,533 scientific institutions
in the world of which 4,126 are universities. Please note that
the Webometrics database of the Spanish Ministry of Science, which evaluates
other parameters, it has more than 31,000 educational institutions
Superior. Scimago Scopus only records 13% of that total, considering the
university institutions with scientific production of certain significance.
In Latin America, the latter evaluates 484 institutions, of which 344 are
universities, and in Argentina it analyzes 58 institutions, of which 26 are
universities (in Latin America, only 10% of universities do
research in a minimum volume to be ranked).
In the five-year period 2014 -2018 (Ranking 2020) in the general evaluation, without
discriminate universities, UNLP is ranked 637 in the world, 30 in
Latin America and 5th 11th in Argentina (Conicet is 199th in the world, 2nd in LA and
1st in Argentina, the UBA is 529th in the world, 13th in AL and 2nd in Argentina and
                                                 
11 This ranking counts separately and places 691 in the world, 57 in Latin America and 9th in Argentina, at the Scientific Center
La Plata Technological Institute of CONICET (CCT La Plata). It has a total of 31 centers and institutes, of which
27 shares with the UNLP, which multiplies and strongly enhances the scientific and technological contribution of the UNLP and
the region.
 
The National University of Córdoba is 681 in the world, 52 in America
Latin and 7th in Argentina).
In the exclusive ranking for universities -4,126 institutions in the world,
344 in Latin America and 26 in Argentina -, the UNLP is positioned 455 in the
world, 19th in Latin America and 2nd in Argentina (the UBA is 31st 5th in the
world, 11th in Latin America and 1st in Argentina, and Córdoba is 681 in the world, 36
in AL and 3rd in Argentina.
Scientific production is highly dependent on investment
economical. For years the UNLP has been steadily increasing the
funds invested in Science and Technology (S&T). In its 2022 budget it allocated
more than 221 million pesos to CyT programs, which represents 3
and a half times more than what is allocated to this function by the budget
national to this University ($62,826,305)12. The effort that the UNLP makes in
matter of investment in S&T is even greater if one considers the part of the
budget not allocated to salaries of the General Administration, this figure
amounts to 25.0% of the total. That is, the real total of investment in CyT in the
UNLP is 30% of the total budget of the UNLP, if we add to the
Presidency program (221 million) the programs of each Faculty
in the matter, plus the cost of services and maintenance, the largest
dedications destined for research and the additional ones granted by the
National Incentive Program for Teachers-Researchers (not included in
budget).
The scientific logistics of the UNLP is made up of 151 units of
research (44 laboratories, 38 centers, 35 institutes and 34 Units
Promotional R&D), 20 of them double dependency with CONICET, 7
triple dependency UNLP/CICpBA/CONICET and 21 associated with the CICpBA. The
number of research teachers categorized in the Program
Incentives is 5.2, 59 of which 2,537 currently receive the incentive
correspondent.
                                                 
12 According to the 2021 national budget, the participation of the CyT function in the UNLP budget is 0.20%
on the total budget – Worksheet A -. The figure approved by the HCS ($147,479,799) grows at 1% of the budget
total. This percentage increases to 1.35% when adding what is received from the Science and Technology Strengthening Program of the
SPU and what corresponds to the collection by Ord, 219 (services to third parties).
 
There are numerous researchers and scholars from other organizations, such as the
CONICET and the CICpBA, which have a workplace in the offices of the
UNLP, totaling more than 2.50013.
For its part, the number of postgraduate scholarship recipients (master's, doctorate and
postdoctoral) of the UNLP reached 270 in 2021, of which
30 correspond to the Doctor Retention Program, created in order to
maintain in the CyT system applicants for admission to the Career of
CONICET Scientific Researcher not entering the 2017 contest and
other similar cases. It should be noted that since March 2020,
numerous extensions in expirations due to the pandemic. Little to
little did the beneficiaries of the doctor retention program achieve
occupy positions with greater dedication in the UNLP, CONICET or other
institutions. UNLP scholarships are added, also with a workplace
at this university, more than 1,000 from CONICET, 65 from CICpBA and more than 30
of the ANPCyT (National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion),
As a whole, there are around 1,500 research scholarship holders.
are in postgraduate training at UNLP. For their part, they add
186 undergraduate students from the Stimulus Scholarship Program
Scientific Vocations of the CIN, in addition to others corresponding to
programs of the faculties.
The scientific activity developed at the UNLP is also reflected in
more than 1,400 projects underway in 2021. Nearly 900 of them are
accredited by the UNLP (763 R&D projects for consolidated groups and
121 Promotional R&D Projects) and the rest are financed by the
CONICET, the ANPCyT and to a lesser extent by the CICpBA. Likewise, it is so
concluding 8 co-financed Oriented Research Projects (PIO)
with CONICET and many others close to starting.
The activity was also reflected in 2,261 articles in refereed journals
(1,765 in the Scopus® database), in addition to 265 articles in magazines without
arbitration and 157 review articles (data corresponding to 2019).
                                                 
13 The CICpBA has 147 researchers linked to the UNLP: 39 associates and 108 career, of which 108 are
also UNLP teachers; 87 technicians, of which 52 have teaching ties with the UNLP and 65 scholarship holders, among
of them 38 with a teaching position at the UNLP, according to 2018/2019 data.
The CCT La Plata of CONICET has a total of 1,515 researchers, professionals and support technicians and 1,161
interns. Of them, 1,802 also have a teaching relationship with the UNLP (data as of December 2018).

In addition, 3,300 contributions or presentations were made at events
scientific-technological with peer evaluation, 665 book chapters
academics with arbi suit and 170 academic books were published.
The visibility of UNLP scientific production in databases
international registers a notable increase in recent years. In it
Five years from 2014 to 2018, 11,306 articles were registered in magazines with
arbitration, 835 books, 3,321 book chapters and 16,542 presentations. For him
same period the number of scientific publications registered in the database
Scopus data is 8,283. Fruit of international cooperation, more than 40%
of the scientific production registered in Scopus corresponds to articles in
collaboration with authors from other countries, mostly from the United States,
Spain, Brazil and Germany.
It is to be expected that these indicators and the visibility of the results of the
research - both at the national level and in Latin America and in the
world - continue to improve, not only due to greater production of people
researchers but also for the gradual adaptation to Resolution 415
of the UNLP, through which researchers must include the name of
the University in the mentions of institutional affiliation of its
publications in such order as to ensure capture by search engines.
As already mentioned, activity growth can also be
verify the increase in the use of the bibliographic provision service that
provides the PREBI as part of LibLink - ISTEC and the UNLP repositories
to download bibliographic material, such as the aforementioned SEDICI (also the
faculties of Humanities and Educational Sciences and of Sciences
Natural and Museum have important repositories). The volume of the
academic and scientific production that the university makes available to the
community as a whole is also verified in the academic search engine
specialized from Google (Google Scholar), SEDICI reaches 122,700 resources
of which 10,871 are postgraduate and undergraduate theses.
Without a doubt, the general objective of the UNLP in research is to promote
activity and put it at the service of the country's development, seeking support
forceful and careful to basic research, but also
promoting lines oriented to sustainability and growth
economic, social and environmental, with equity, and better quality,
 
ensuring that the relevance and relevance of that knowledge
contribute to collective progress. Along these lines, specific objectives are
consolidation of research units, training of resources
human resources, the protection of trained human resources, the growth
in projects and new lines of research, the promotion of
scientific, technological and artistic information and dissemination, monitoring and
evaluation of production and quality in research units, the
promotion of entrepreneurship, technological innovation and study
of productive chains and the protection of knowledge
transferable. It is essential to promote associativity with the productive sector
through projects with Chambers, companies and cooperatives promoting
process innovation and the incorporation of technology that allows the
better integration to the new digital economy. Encourage transfer to
means of scientific and technological knowledge through Startups, Spin -
Off and Pilot Plants as a cornerstone of generating initiatives
entrepreneurs in our graduates.
Execute an institutional linkage policy through the
transfer of knowledge made available to the demands of the
society, taking care of the environment, accompanying the development
technological, technical assistance, innovative vocation and involvement
directly with production and work, providing the answers that the
civil society organizations, the business sector and the administration
state requires and even encourages the entrepreneurial potential of
members of the university community. In this sense it is worth highlighting,
among others, research and technological developments aimed at
production of dehydrated foods, prefabricated housing,
generic medications, vaccines and even lithium cells and batteries,
indicated in the section “Priorities in the UNLP” (point 3).
It is essential, in addition to having an appropriate budget, to generate
the management devices necessary for the implementation of the scholarships
of research, subsidies and greater dedication, having the
necessary equipment and good buildings, quick and agile access to
information, the permanent training of researchers and technologists, the
 
adequate protection, dissemination and exchange of knowledge
generated and transferred.
Further growth is expected in scholarship stipends
research, in subsidies and in greater dedications14, although the
increases in the period are important both for scholarships, in which
increased their number and amount, as well as for subsidies of various kinds,
among them subsidies for accredited projects (R&D for groups
consolidated and Promotional R&D) and those specific to young people
researchers. As already analyzed, the greatest dedications had a
marked growth in these years, although the horizon that
we propose to achieve will require a great effort.
The UNLP must have more doctors, in that sense the support courses,
Incentives for faculties and free doctorates allow
the growth rate is significant. The new scholarship regulations
research, put into effect in 2018, also tends to expand
the number of researchers with postgraduate qualifications as well as the
free of charge for all postgraduate courses for UNLP teachers.
However, and despite the progress made, retaining these resources
human beings trained by the UNLP itself is a necessary objective to achieve
in all its dimensions, guaranteeing the teaching position for those who
He trained in postgraduate studies with scholarships from the Institution.
With the aim of increasingly facilitating mobility and internationalization
of scientific work, the allocation increased considerably
intended for financial aid subsidies for travel and stays, which
grants almost 300 grants annually, countless funding agreements were made
exchange and free language training was implemented for
research teachers.
In order to promote and recognize the production activity of
knowledge and its transfer, since 2010 the Prize has been awarded
annual Scientific, Technological and Artistic Work to trained researchers
                                                 
14 In March 2022, the UNLP had 1,318 full-time teachers (including schools) and
2,291 with semi-exclusive dedication out of a total of 14,846 teachers, reaching 24.31% of the total. To this they must
join 836 UNLP teachers who are paid exclusively for CONICET (in addition to a dedicated
simple in the UNLP). This adds up to 4,445 higher dedications, which means 30.00% of the total number of teachers, percentage
similar to the 29.53% of higher dedications equivalent to the national average in Public Universities in the
year 2020.
 
and young researchers from all the Academic Units and in 2013
added the annual Innovation Award.
With the aim of promoting researchers in training to start in
project management, a Project program is supported and subsidized
Promotional Research and Development -PPID -.
To improve the organization of groups of researchers and technologists
of the Faculties in Research Units (UI), the Ordinance was reformed
No. 284 of laboratories, centers and institutes, updating the conditions for
its recognition and operation and facilitating the creation of units
smaller in order to generate critical mass and recognize those
groups that, due to their characteristics, do not qualify as laboratories according to the
current standard.
In this sense, the registry of the different UIs was published with their main
lines of research and an open database was managed with the registry
updated researchers and projects and a UI Portal.
Two web portals were also designed and implemented through SEDICI,
one for the management and virtual publication of indexed scientific journals
http://revistas.unlp.edu.ar/cientificas (today the SEDICI manages and shows 95
magazines) and another for the virtual management of the organization of events
scientists http://congresos.unlp.edu.ar.
To facilitate quick and agile access to information, it was reinforced
The development of the UNLP repositories was sustained, the wiring was extended
of fiber optics throughout the university and free wireless access to
Internet in all its areas.
In order for more and more students to start early in
research, in 2011 the Research Program was promoted together with other universities.
Scholarships to Stimulate Scientific Vocations from the CIN. The UNLP is the
university that presents and incorporates the most applicants annually. Besides,
With own resources, more scholarships are added per faculty. Since 2011
The number of scholarships for scientific vocations continues to increase
(currently 186 are in force).
Along these lines, in 2015, the XXIII Conference of
Young Researchers of the Montevideo Group, an event that brought together more than
800 young researchers from Latin America and valued the work of the
 
young researchers from the UNLP. The central theme was Science, technology
and innovation for social inclusion. Nearly 640 works were presented that
They were presented in poster format and more than 130 oral presentations.
It is necessary to have the appropriate equipment and buildings. In this
In this sense, a financing program was implemented for the purchase of
small facilities with periodic calls. It is also managed
before the ANPCyT the purchase of large and a half pieces of equipment, contributing
the required counterpart and work on a database of equipment and
available instruments that promote their use in a consortium.
In 2018 and 2019, surveys were carried out on repair needs
and maintenance of equipment in research units of the
UNLP and shared dependency with CONICET/CICpBA. With the purpose of
putting unused or underused equipment into operation, the UNLP has
made an investment of more than 70 million pesos.
In addition, a management program for the withdrawal and retirement of employees is implemented.

The UNLP promotes more research on topics of strategic interest to
the development of the country, the province and the region, seeking the greatest
coincidence between the scientific-technological agenda and the social agenda. The
issues of energy, water, food, health, housing,
of the environment and information technology are fundamental, as well as
those of poverty, production, mobility and urban sustainability in
general, among others that define the quality of life of our communities.
Thus, in 2010, a process of incentives for topics of interest began.
social, incorporating into the budget an item to compete annually
These types of projects, which are called Research Projects,
Innovation and Transfer in Priority Areas -PIITAP -, with a successful
call, a process that is expanded with initiatives from some
faculties, of the Social Council of the UNLP and that is being consolidated from
of the call to join various organizations in the public sphere and
private.
In 2011 and 2013, the priority lines of the PIITAP calls were
proposed and evaluated for their relevance by the Social Council of the
University, and technically by commissions of specialists.
In 2011 the call was aimed at the generation of New
Productive Enterprises for the Municipalities of the Region, addressing
 
diverse topics such as local tourism, development of dairy production,
generation of food processing plants together with small
family producers, and many more.
Subsequently, the Social Council resolved to allocate all of the resources
to the generation of two large interdisciplinary and interactive projects:
Social Management of Urban Solid Waste and Social Production of Habitat
Sustainable. Both projects continue in development, integrating
different areas of the State, territorial organizations and teams of
research and transfer of ten academic units, on topics of
high social impact.
In 2013 - after the floods of April 2 - the PIITAP were
addressed the issue of the water emergency and CONICET was incorporated into the
initiative, gathering a fund destined for projects aimed at contributing to the
environment, floods and other disasters that could affect
to the region, promoting the integration of multidisciplinary teams,
inter-institutes and inter-faculties for its development. In this way it
financed 5 Oriented Research Projects (PIO) whose results
They have been available since 2016 and are very useful to institutions
beneficiaries (ADA, Municipality of La Plata, OPDS and or after).
From that first experience of PIO co-financed between UNLP and
CONICET, a new agreement was signed to contribute to the problem
agriculture of the region, especially that referred to the horticultural belt of the
La Plata Party.
8 new PIOs will soon begin their development in collaboration with
CONICET and the Arturo Jauretche National University on issues of
Food and quality of life; Energies and environment; Social demands and Health
and health context, with special attention to the Province of Buenos Aires.
In the same sense as the PIITAP, the CIN and the MinCyT promoted
creation of the Technological and Social Development Projects (PDTS),
having actively participated in the first call of the CIN, where
6 projects based at the UNLP and several others obtained financing
based in other UUNN with the participation of researchers from this
university. At the same time, efforts were made to ensure that projects with results
transferable assets make up the National Bank of PDTS of the MinCyT.
 
Along these lines, in 2012 a great achievement was managed and obtained for the
scientific activity of the UNLP: that the company YPF Tecnología -Y-TEC-,
integrated by YPF Pública and CONICET and dedicated to research
energy in general (alternative fuels, alternative energies, etc.),
with about 300 researchers, is located on the property owned by the UNLP in
Berisso, called Campo 6 de Agosto. Since 2016 the building is already a
reality in operation.
During 2014, the loan was obtained from the Provincial Government.
and in 2017, based on a Provincial Law, definitive ownership was obtained
of the property located at 64 and diagonal 113, whose destination is Centros
Productive Research, Innovation and Transfer, the Scientific Center

Applied to Water and the Environment (CIIAAA), a space where they come together
different institutions to provide concrete responses to the main
water and environmental problems that affect the region. They form
part of this inter-institutional center are the UNLP, the UNNOBA, the CIC of the
Province of Buenos Aires, CONICET and the National Water Institute (INA).
This institute articulates the lines of research that we have already been carrying out.
on water and will fundamentally follow the water footprint in activities
productive. The complex is completed with the Research Center,
development, evaluation and production of Vaccines and the Battery Factory
Lithium and comprises more than 10,000 m2.
This step will allow us to promote associative initiatives with our graduates
innovators and entrepreneurs, such as an agreement with the DILP -District
La Plata IT - which brings together dozens of small entrepreneurs
computer scientists - the majority graduated from this university - so that
build their own building on the UNLP property, promoting a
unprecedented synergy between the academic and business spheres in this line of
knowledge.
It is about promoting a culture of innovation that values the
capabilities of our scientific and technological sector at the service and associate
to the needs of the productive and social sectors of our region and
the country.
 
For several years, in the scientific career he established himself as
researchers' evaluation parameter, the number of articles
published in high-impact indexed journals. Without a doubt, the production of
Knowledge is a fundamental issue in the process of developing a
country and this is important information, but this process cannot
exclude the development of transferable and innovation projects, especially
in the topics of the outlined agenda, and therefore the protection of many of
that knowledge through patents.
Along these lines, the CIN, the MINCyT and the UNLP promote the
oriented research, technological and artistic projects and
environmental and socio-productive developments that pursue two results
applicable for the benefit of society, particularly those patentable, or
capable of being protected, and the progressive articulation between the Ministry
of Science, the innovative entrepreneurial company and the University through
of consortia, in an ethical framework of scientific knowledge always
necessary to guard and delve into specific references. The same
time, there is a tendency towards a correct assessment of these activities in the
evaluation of researchers/technologists and their recognition in the
evaluation of the greatest dedications.
The UNLP has at the disposal of its teachers, researchers and technologists a
assistance, training and management service for the protection of
creations, developments and the knowledge generated in its field, through
of the registration of patents, trademarks, copyrights, new web pages and
software.
Public universities are the fundamental power plant for the production of
knowledge in countries like ours, and promote and encourage its registration
and protection through various mechanisms, but fundamentally

publication of indicators for the year 2019 (in 2021), ratifies the RICyT data.
Beyond the fact that this figure is in itself very low in relation to other neighboring countries such as Brazil, in that context, and only

In this sense, Argentine universities have a lot to contribute, so
that this line of work will be central for the coming years.
For now, the UNLP developed communication software
inventions to facilitate and optimize interaction with the community
researcher, which will constitute a valuable tool for the purposes of
protection and transfer of knowledge generated in the field of
our institution. The importance of this instrument lies in generating
a virtual space for consultation on the possible protection of results
obtained by the members of the university community, from
of which the patentability evaluation process begins at the Office
of the Intellectual Property Directorate (DPI).
As a complement, the training modality was implemented
continuous training in all faculties on a rotating basis on patent and
technological information, and on the use of new communication software
of invention, under the modality of a Workshop Day, where the
community members to share their experiences in protecting
knowledge. All of this for the purpose of bringing the university community closer to
the importance of the topic.
Likewise, in order to stimulate the effective protection of
knowledge generated, the incorporation of incentive prizes and
institutional recognition of patenting, as well as
promotes the incorporation of higher evaluation scores in the forms
of categorization, when it comes to investigations that have concluded their
works with the generation of protected knowledge or technology.
Since 2018, the areas of entrepreneurship and innovation have focused
decisively to promote technological scaling, carrying out
training and recruitment activities for research projects with
impact on the productive sector. In this way, from the Incubator
Minerva has led this process. Examples of this are intervention in

of this aggressive policy of case identification, support and
search for financing, will be reflected in the coming years with the
establishment of these future Technology-Based Companies in the
properties of 64 and diagonal 113, of the 6 de Agosto field of Berisso, of the property
of 66 and 167 and others in management.

OPPORTUNITIES
• The Extension has been prioritized at the national level, promoted and
promoted by effective policies of all the Institutions of the
university system, homologating it in its scope to the
traditional teaching and research.
• There is an external complement to the university system, through
calls that still exist in the areas of the State and agencies
mixed, national and foreign that allow the development of
projects and programs, as well as external subsidies
destined for communication equipment and financing of
training and connection activities with the environment.
• Recognition of other governmental institutions and not
government, in the capacity and level of professionalization of the

Positive assessment of the Council in teacher training actions
such as Specialization in University Teaching
 
WEAKNESSES
• The still incipient systematization of experiences and the incomplete
Defining the appropriate methodological instruments makes it difficult to
comprehensive evaluation of the actions carried out.
• Little articulation with the results and diagnoses detected in
university research projects, when planning
extension interventions and vice versa.
• The need to rent to those who carry out work and tasks
extension workers, to sustain and guarantee the continuity of work.
• Little incorporation of training activities, contents
curricular and compulsory subjects, intended for the
transmission of methodologies and experiences in university extension,
in undergraduate and postgraduate courses.
• The administrative order, traditionally organized for tasks
of teaching and research, still lacks adequate processes
for the specificities of the Extension. This is verifiable not only in
procedural instruments but also in the lack of inclusion
 
of the extensionist particularities in the training of the
staff.
• Lack of monitoring, evaluation and return of actions
carried out as well as graduate training, as
human resources necessary for the execution of projects and
programs.
• There are deficiencies linked to organizational dimensions,
administrative, budgetary, infrastructure and employee profiles
management, for sustained and broader participation in
inclusive public policy production processes.
• Existence of temporal and administrative logics that are not
correspond to real-time policy execution processes
public and reconfiguration of social problems.
• Insufficient budget and organizational structure for the
addressing the complexity of social problems.
• Certain resistance to the changes that are taking place regarding the
recognition of rights, especially women's rights.
• Limitations in the own budget for the development of more
actions of the Secretary.
• Little knowledge of the importance and value of environmental issues
as a comprehensive proposal.
• Lack of internal communication to disseminate activities
linked to the environment, which reduce their impact.
• Superposition of projects and programs that work on themes
related or that at some point could be connected.
• Insufficient provision of support personnel, space and
equipment for managing activities
• Dependency on external resources for the implementation of the
activities. Insufficient space and equipment for the management of
activities. Limited resources for editing and publishing
teaching materials.
• Difficulties in combining the times required to provide
response to demands from social organizations and
public institutions and those established in each area of the UNLP.
 
Discontinuation of the Council's editorial line regarding disclosure
of their activities.
 
THREATS
• The inherent complexity in the social field, to the extent that it is not
attended or viewed, could affect the level of intervention and
expected responses, as well as in planning
stipulated by the extension teams, forcing them to a
constant readjustment.
• To the extent that it is not viewed as a need, for different reasons
reasons v linked to training, the curricular incorporation of
university extension, a lack of motivation could occur and
teachers' inclination to carry out other tasks that do not
involve extension as a priority.
• The existence of actions that are not the results of lawsuits and that
do not attend to the existing complexities impact the quality of
the results obtained.
• The overlap of activities in the same recipients and the lack
of articulation, they constitute obstacles.

The general objective of this university in the extension is to direct it towards the
solidarity commitment, community organization, and the support of

Deepen the implementation of the new ordinary call for
Programs, Projects and Extension Activities, is presented as another of
the central objectives of the function, as well as developing and consolidating
Specialization in University Extension as a training path
recognized in Latin America that proposes to prioritize the extension with the
in order to contribute to the development of comprehensive university training in
dialogue with actors, practices and processes of the social environment. At the same time, it seeks
enhance the structure of the media and publications of the UNLP to achieve
its transmedia convergence, and strengthen communication strategies
digital of their productions, in order to expand their audiences and contribute
original and quality content that adapts to the transformations
generations in terms of media consumption. From a
understanding of university media as stages of debate
democratic and the meeting of territories, it is committed to multiplying the
extension policies in communication to provide a public service
that contributes to decision-making about community well-being.
The academic Health policies at the University have been consolidated in
recent years from the creation and strengthening of a space of
specific management. Thus, the Ministry of Health promotes
formation of an integrated university training system,
interdisciplinary and multi-actor, in coordination with the public system of
health of the region, guaranteeing comprehensive training of excellence and
promoting the social commitment of professionals who work
in said field, for the direct benefit of the community. For this it articulates with
the public health system, at its different levels, and with the activity of
teaching, extension and research that develop health careers of
the UNLP, analyzing the health problems of the population and formulating
possible solutions, from a conception of interdisciplinary health,
collective, and understood as a right to be guaranteed by the State.
The global health emergency situation, resulting from the pandemic
Covid - 19, prompted the University to implement interventions that
 
health situation imposed as urgent. In this sense, Health
created and launched swabbing and vaccination centers,
They constantly carried out testing and vaccination operations in the
neighborhoods and most vulnerable areas of the region and a space for
university volunteering that allowed us to sustain the presence and
response of the University in the community. The articulation with the system
of provincial health, which was strengthened within the framework of these interventions in
health actions of university volunteering, now makes possible the
implementation of the SURES Program (Regional University System of
Health), in which the Extension Secretariat also participates.
The National University of La Plata formalized the formation of spaces
of trans and interdisciplinary work aimed at producing knowledge
on health problems, the population's right to health,
conditions of employment and work of health workers, and to produce
training and labor processes of students and graduates.
For this purpose, the Advisory Commission of Academic Health Programs,
in which the health areas of municipal governments also participate
and provincial, promotes the implementation of impact policies such as
projects included in the PADEI and strengthens existing lines of work
such as community health, addiction prevention, mental health and
animal health and zoonotic diseases.
The general program Public Policies with Social Inclusion is anchored in the
Secretary of Social Policies, organizational representation space
institutional of the Faculty of Social Work from where it is supported in
four consecutive management periods the primary function of “designing,
propose, implement and evaluate policies that integrate knowledge and practices
social, educational, training and knowledge production for the
addressing social problems on the regional public agenda and strengthening
of individual and collective capabilities from the perspective of rights.”
This mission is accompanied transversally by permanent production
of knowledge sustained by participation in research projects
from the organization and contribution to the training of graduates
university students who are committed to the problematization of the social, the
 
recognition of popular knowledge and decision making that
involve social actors in the public policy production process.
The sustained organizational structure allowed the implementation in
simultaneous development of a set of strategic lines linked to the
strengthening processes and sectors of social and popular economy
solidarity, participation in design, implementation and
evaluation of public policies, the implementation of
professional training in trades and articulated management of practices

region from a rights perspective.
 
Following Argentina's decision to adhere to the SDGs, the Ministries of
Environment and Sustainable Development and Ministry of Education and Sports of
the Nation signed a framework agreement to jointly develop
a public policy on environmental education. Between his
main commitments this policy proposes the development of a Strategy
National Environmental Education System (ENEA), configuring the Strategy
National for Sustainable Universities. The UNLP as a member
active, participated through the Prosecretariat of University Welfare in the
Network of Argentine Universities for Environmental Management and Inclusion
Social (UAGAIS NETWORK)
At the same time, the Prosecretariat of University Welfare promoted
the development of EcoHealthy policies, linked to three axes: promotion,
prevention, education and health care; promoting comprehensive development
from generating sports, recreational and educational spaces; and the quality
in the areas of labor and environmental management.
In the second item, within the recreational activities organized in
together with the General Directorate of Sports of the University, stand out
the UNLP Delfor De la Canal Marathon, free open classes and
recreational, the Olympics and university tournaments.
The purpose of these proposals lies in the notion that activities such as
Sport and healthy competition promote the integral formation of the being
human, non-delegable responsibility of the Argentine Public University.
In addition, it seeks to strengthen the value of solidarity and social commitment.
through different campaigns. These activities seek to combat the
epidemic of chronic non-communicable diseases (diabetes, cancer,
cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases,
kidney disease), which constitute the main cause of death in our
country and in the world, which are increasing due to the aging of
the population and current lifestyles that accentuate sedentary lifestyle and
bad nutrition.
Particularly with the Marathon, this event is free, cardio-safe and open
to the entire community, being the most multitudinous in the region, it is proclaimed and
implements the Separation of Urban Solid Waste (MSW) at source,
 
both dry and wet waste in green and black bags, respectively
at different points along the route.
Since 2014, the Marathon has pursued a solidarity goal in collaboration with the
Food Bank of La Plata, a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)
that recovers food and raises awareness to reduce hunger and
malnutrition. In the last editions, more than 15,000 kilos of
non-perishable food provided by the participants, which were
delivered to 90 institutions in the region with which the Bank works.
In addition, in 2015 the race had the motto “Let's run towards the
sustainability”, seeking to raise awareness about the importance of
use alternative energies and the need to take care of public space
separating urban solid waste (MSW). In this framework, the program
We recovered received more than 2,000 commercial plastic bags per
part of the runners in exchange for a reusable cloth bag. With these
bags, an artistic installation was made that was exhibited at the Center
Cultural Recoleta and in the patio of the UNLP Residence P Building.
In the last axis of eco-healthy policies, the Program was carried out
University Environmental Commitment, and within the framework of this policy
strategic, the Recover sub-program was implemented, approved by
resolution 237/11 of the UNLP Presidency, within which
actions aimed at improving the management of Urban Solid Waste
(RSU) in faculties and departments and research centers.
Currently, the Program is implemented in the Presidency of
the UNLP, in the Faculties of Architecture and Urban Planning, Legal Sciences and
Social Sciences, Economic Sciences, Computer Science, Dentistry, the National College
“Rafael Hernández” and the “Joaquín V. González” Graduate School.
Continuing with this line, it is promoted to implement policies in the different
University spaces with an environmental perspective, such as:
• work for sustainable food
• the non-use of plastics in university canteens
• the implementation of drinking fountains in them
• verification of the traceability of the waste generated to its
sustainable destinations, giving the recently sanctioned resolution,
317/20 of the Ministry of Environment of the province of Buenos Aires.
 
• reception points for used vegetable oil (A VU) and give a solution
sustainable to fat of animal origin generated in the kitchen of
university dining halls, contributing to the production of
second generation biofuels.
The Prosecretariat of University Welfare and the Secretariat of Extension of the
Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning of the UNLP promoted the course of
Environmental Promoters by which 260 agents, neighbors and
microentrepreneurs from 13 municipalities of the Province of Buenos Aires
They received training in environmental matters. With this activity we aim to
exchange knowledge and experiences, create strategic alliances, and seek
encourage work and articulation linked to separation, recovery of
Urban Solid Waste (MSW), SDG agenda 2030, circular economy among
other themes. Likewise, it promotes the formation of public spaces and
healthy and sustainable private sector.
77 people participated in the first instance, and 183 in the second.

Berisso, Bran dsen, Chascomús, Florencio Varela, General Belgrano, La Plata,
Luján, Magdalena, Pinamar and Villa Gesell.
In the training space, the need to create synergy to
develop effective comprehensive and inclusive management of MSW that is
generated with the characteristics of each community, to avoid the
damage they cause to the environment when these lack valuation both
environmental as well as social. In this sense, work was done on the implementation of
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
In addition, information was provided on the benefits of protection.
of the natural environment and the protection of the environment on our
well-being in order to generate habits and behaviors in the community that
allows us to become aware of the environmental problems that
go through, incorporating values and providing tools that tend to
mitigate them, but first to prevent them.
Returning to the Recover Program, it should be noted that its
main recipient to the University Community, then by the modality
of the productive circuit of the region to the cooperatives with which
manage agreements and as indirect recipients the community, in
 
general through the expansion of knowledge and practices of the
university community to its surroundings. This way it comes directly
to approximately 140,000 people including students, teachers,
Novices and graduates and indirectly to 800,000 inhabitants of the
Greater La Plata (according to the 2010 census).
One of the main activities carried out by the program is the dissemination
of the same and awareness of the benefits of separation in origin and
recycling for the entire community, through graphic or digital media and
with the organization of events such as the I Recycling Conference and
environmental, University Expo, University Marathon, visits to schools of
the region, both private and provincial, participation in conferences and
other University Extension activities positioning UNLP as
institution that generates sustainable environmental policies in the region.
Likewise, from UNLP Environmental Commitment, participation in forums
national and international in relation to the dissemination and topics on
SDG.
On the other hand, the growing concern for the environment, the change
climate, and the conservation of natural resources drove the
development of new strategic spaces within the UNLP that serve
specifically this problem, with the purpose of deepening, creating
policies and provide responses to the demands of our society. It is so
For the first time, the UNLP has a Secretariat of Environment and
Conservation of Natural Resources and within it under the orbit of the
PProsecretariat of Environmental Management Policies concentrated
efforts and programs that were being developed between 2010 -2022 in the
Prosecretariat of University Welfare
Given demographic growth, which leads to an increase in demand for
food, raw materials and energy, sustainable management is required
of natural resources, in the search for reducing impacts
negative effects on the environment during the different productive stages. This
accompanied by the generation of responsible consumers, who
through their actions minimize their ecological impact and increase their
positive effect on society. In this last aspect, it is important
principle of the 3Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle, starting point for a
circular economy model.
In this context, from the Sustainable Management Department, there have been
developed actions to give visibility and generate spaces for
training, training, exchange and construction of knowledge in the
Good Practices in Production, Manufacturing and Environmental, as well as
also in Bioeconomy, promoting the application of the criteria of the
Agenda 2030 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of Nations
United.
These tasks were carried out together with: a) academic units and training centers
UNLP research, such as the faculties of Cs. Agricultural and Forestry,
Cs. Naturals, Cs. Exactly, Cs. Economics and Engineering; b) institutions
nationals through agreements such as the Argentine Engineering Association
Health and Environmental (AIDIS), the Professional Engineering Council
Agronomic (CPIA), the Argentine Association of Sowing Producers
Directa (Aapresid), the CampoLimpio Civil Association, the Health Chamber
Agriculture and Fertilizers (CASAFE), the Council of Federations of
Volunteer Firefighters of the Argentine Republic, the Recycling Cooperative
Conciencia, the Río Colorado Development Corporation (CORFO), the Association
Argentina of Regional Agricultural Experimentation Consortiums (AACREA),
New World Truffles and Successors of Amado r López (Chacra Don Ángel -
Tandil); and international such as the International Engineering Center
Genetics and Biotechnology (ICGEB – Italy headquarters) and the Research Group
GESPLAN from the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM - Spain); c)
national, provincial and municipal public organizations; d) associations and
NGOs such as Alcachofas Platenses, Argentine Association of Flower Growers and
Nurseries, Network of Native Plant Nurseries of Argentina (REVINA), Week
of the Tree -Club of Rome, Gómez Recicla Project, E cobotellas La Plata, and the
Environmental Commission, made up of COA La Plata, Argentine Guides, Friday
for Future, Fair Environment and Linden Leaf.
Based on this work, three editions of the conference were carried out.
“Transforming Waste into Resources” in which
successful experiences around the treatment of urban and rural waste
and industrial and their transformation into resources, with the participation of
 
different social actors, under circular economy concepts, prioritizing
their reincorporation into the economic chain; three courses
international postgraduate courses on the generation and production of
bioinputs and bioenergies, training in green roofs and gardens
verticals, production of specimens of native herbaceous species and
trees, management of urban trees, domestic gardens, separation of
waste at source and composting, renewable energies and energy efficiency,
sustainable mobility, good agricultural practices, investment principles
responsible for agriculture (IRA), management of phytosanitary packaging; and
conferences with participatory debate on climate change and conservation
of biodiversity.
Active participation in forums and debate spaces on SDGs
promoted by civil associations and public organizations, as well as
in the Commission for Comprehensive Training in the Environment, Sustainable Development and
Climate Change, created within the UNLP to provide the
training on environmental issues within the framework of the Yolanda Law within
of the institution.
The Directorate is part of an extension work group
interdisciplinary, having participated in a project of the call
2018 of the Secretariat of University Policies of the Ministry of Education
of the Nation (Strengthening SME Management) and the ordinary call
2021 UNLP (Strengthening Tres Arroyos SME Management, Second Stage), the
which arise from the need to provide support to SMEs in the
agri-food chain of Benito Juárez and Tres Arroyos, designing a
system of economic-social indicators for decision making,
proving essential to evaluate and predict trends in the situation
of the region regarding the strengthening of productive chains and
social economy ventures.
The generation of participatory spaces in the Management resulted in
i) the Technical Working Group “We are not disposable” with the objective of
design an awareness strategy to discourage the use of
single-use plastics within the UNLP and ii) the “One Tree” Program
by Graduate” ⁠⠀ with the purpose of working in production and forestry
with native specimens of local green spaces, regional centers
 
university campuses and rural properties of the UNLP that do not have species
tree species (or that must be replaced), in relation to the annual number of
graduates of the Institution, enhancing our social commitment to
environmental education, both within the academic community, as well as
also in society in general.
The Human Rights policy of the UNLP was hierarchized through
the Secretary of Human Rights and Equality Policies from this
management.
It is undergoing a process of institutional growth and consolidation, with the active
participation in both training and social processes linked to the
human rights movement and different social organizations. This
institutional policy becomes relevant, becoming a reference for
universities of the country and the region.
From this institutional area we work on programs and activities that
They have as their objective the transversality of the different themes in a way
coordinated with other management areas of the Presidency, and its units
academic and administrative, both at undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate levels.
The recognition, respect and defense of human rights is promoted
as an ethical imperative, from actions that include: the eradication of all
form of violence, discrimination, oppression and domination; the work of
resignification of the recent past promoting memory, truth,
justice and reparation; the fight for equality, social justice, equity
of genre; the defense and enrichment of our heritage
cultural and environmental; food security and sovereignty and
eradication of hunger and poverty; intercultural dialogue with full
respect for identities and the promotion of a culture of peace, guaranteeing
inclusion, equal opportunities and the social right to education
for all people.
The Secretary of Human Rights and Equality Policies fights for the
conditions that effectuate the access, permanence and exit of the
students, promoting respect for multiculturalism, the identity of
gender, democracy and fundamental freedoms, as contents
academics.
 
The Social Council was created by the Superior Council of the UNLP in the year
2010, at the proposal of the presidency and in the heat of the
recovery of Extension as the main tool of expression of
university social commitment.
Throughout the 12 years of its development it has generated Commissions
permanent areas with various work axes, technical tables,
conflict management and training proposals aimed at
strengthening community capacities.
The Social Council has contributed to involving the University in agendas
legislative, proposal and implementation of public policies and development of
projects with municipalities and social actors in the region around access
just to the habitat, the strengthening of the popular, social and solidarity economy,
to the rights of children and youth, of migrant communities, to
community health promotion processes, among many other topics.
In this period of management he has great challenges ahead. On the one hand,
in articulation with science and technology organizations and the areas of
science, technology, innovation and production of UNLP itself, is presented
the opportunity to launch the Interinstitutional Center for the
Development of the Popular, Social and Solidarity Economy, which articulates
capabilities and proposals based on the production of knowledge of
these organizations, with initiatives and productive needs of the spaces
self-managed initiatives that different social organizations have been generating.
This implies having human resources that think, within the framework of their
disciplinary developments, such as improving and/or generating sources of work that
members of the organizations have been promoting, in addition to generating
prospective studies of regional value chains to propose
future developments.
It also has to strengthen and prioritize training processes
community consolidated in Diplo maturas, Courses and Workshops, guaranteeing
the access of more and more sectors to this training, in dialogue with policies
public that recognize and value the community roles with which
they link.
 
Finally, also at this stage the challenge of questioning
much more broadly to the University itself, with the learning that
emerge from the work of the Social Council, contributing to rethinking practices and
institutional policies.

5. SWOT ANALYSIS
 
STRENGTHS
• During the period 2018 -2022, the Ministry of Art and Culture achieved
establish itself with its own identity both in the institutional structure
as in the daily life of university and city life. In
this sense, in addition to the activities and areas existing before
the creation of the Secretariat, the implementation of
progress, growth and development of the Art Center and the Program
PAIR.
• The actions carried out by the Secretariat in this period have
allowed us to show that art and culture have great
work and construction capacity with the different formats of
production and presentation. The Art and Culture Biennials,
very diverse activities implemented in the Art Center, the
adaptation of the dissemination of the achievements of the PAR Program in
the framework of the pandemic (which completely altered all channels

to generate the conditions of adaptability to spaces and areas

potential to be artistically appropriated.
• Linkage channels have been established with the productions of
the different Academic Units and Dependencies that
allowed the realization of a mega-event like the exhibition
Planeta Agua (2019), in which various faculties participated in
an unprecedented production in the history of the UNLP and likely to be
sustained as a permanent line of action and construction of a
common identity between the areas of the Secretariat and the Faculties and
Schools. On the other hand, the link with the Faculty of Arts, more
closely related by disciplinary affinity, is found

• The importance of the creation of the Art Archive of the Art Center,
in 2020, with regard to safeguarding, enhancing,
dissemination and access to the visual and documentary memory of the
artistic trajectories of the artists from La Plata who, in terms
general, have been silenced, unknown or little frequented
for the history of art. This is how, from the public perspective, the Archive
assumes the importance of democratizing access to heritage
common, to encourage future research and make it available
of the community by removing it from oblivion.
 
• The PAR Program has achieved in its four editions so far

OPPORTUNITIES
• The existence of this Strategy has been enhanced with the development
of the management through the Secretariat of Art and Culture that was
created at the same time as the then Ministry of Culture of
the Nation, which presented a unique opportunity regarding
the articulation of projects and programs, institutional linkage and
support for local productions with national projection and

• Strengthening institutional links between Units

emanated from the Secretariat of Art and Culture of the UNLP.
• Strengthening and promoting institutional links with
other national universities and Latin American universities
in the continuous professionalization of the different members of this
University, the diversity of contexts of production and dissemination of
cultural and artistic practices with their local particularities,
 
and its regional vision in the construction of citizenship in the
different societies.
• Consolidation of work in National University Networks, among

• Participation in the collective political decision of our
University that interprets and concretizes a social expectation that
continues to take shape, constituting continuity within this
project.
• Recognition from the CIN for artistic research with the same
hierarchy than the scientific and technological one.
 
WEAKNESSES
• The Strategy has youth inherent to its almost exclusive anchoring
to the Secretariat of Art and Culture, created and implemented in the
previous management, plus the institutional baggage of an organization
centenary as the University is d. This dyad is constituted with
tensions in the process of organization, compatibility and
university universalization. They are not minor, in this sense,
complementary needs in the technological, procedural
administrative, the integrative adaptation in the Identity

• Continuity of tensions originating from preconceptions that
they overshadow the singularity of artistic language and subsume it to
subcategories of other disciplinary fields such as sociology,
communication or history, weakening its epistemological entity and
consequently limiting the possibility of increasing resources
specific according to the necessary magnitudes of the tasks
undertaken and carried out.
• Incipient development of instruments and actions with specific goals
communication with the different Academic Units and
Dependencies, which begins to make knowledge compatible
 
mutual understanding of the strengths, demands and specific needs of the
academic communities.
• The growth and strengthening that the Strategy had during the
previous period (in regards to content generation,
installation in the institutional culture and in the community,
construction of a reference space for the community
artistic and for the public) come into tension and find limits
to the further expansions and growths that are seen as
possible as needs and demands appear
generated by the volume of work handled by the areas
involved in the strategy that do not find correlation in the
general budget issue. There are a number of issues
that would require a review of both the budget allocation
of the Secretariat as well as the streamlining of mechanisms and priorities
to solve problems of various kinds (mainly, of
hiring highly specialized personnelzated, provision of
specific equipment and adaptation and maintenance of
buildings and work spaces.
 
THREATS
• Like any young space in an authorization structure

evident in the detail of the non-specific nature of the evaluation of the
works, research work and artistic products;
almost always thrown into the place of other fields of knowledge,
valuing the contributions of art and culture to the enrichment of the
social life and the construction of subjectivity. On the other hand, the
unresolved discussion around popular art and the crisis of art forms
traditional forms of circulation generate priorities and themes of other
agendas that continue to impact the strategic consolidation of
the objectives, products and processes agreed upon as a community

so careless
 
6. THE STRATEGY SCENARIO IN THE PLAN
The first area is made up of the entire social group; this implies
that it is not an elitist conception of art and culture and that therefore
Consequently, the consequences of what emanates from this Strategy will address
in the same way to the traditional art circuits whose routes are
theaters, movie theaters, auditoriums, museums, specialized audiences,
as well as the neighborhoods, the street, the walls, the patios, the
settlements, villages, billboards, television, social networks, etc.
The second area that delimits the incumbency is the Homeland. In a moment
in which the relationship between the universality that a world poses
 
globalized and hyperconnected seems to collide with the split of the totality
by specific groups in regions that pose a
recognition of their autonomy. The national dimension is in the process of
concrete struggles and tensions of possibility, so the constitution of
policies that transcend the local, must be reinforced in the positions
achieved in terms of its extension and massiveness.
The third area is constituted by continental realities and
world, based on the experiences achieved of unity, today in
unseen hegemonic reorganizations and rearrangements even in its
warlike tradition, threatening, concentrator of goods and services.
This Art and Culture Strategy, given these present trends, the
serves by updating its commitment to public projection and
democratic character, reaffirming its Latin American will, in a
construction and joint work that improves the quality of life of
citizens with an equitable distribution of symbolic goods,
promote social inclusion and active participation of the sectors
academic and social.

instrumental and logical conflicts from the conceptions of
effectiveness, efficiency, transparency, evaluation and control.
 
THREATS
● Delays in granting and accessing financing lines
● Uncertainty regarding the maintenance of the level of increase
university budget.
 
6. SCENARIO OF THE PLAN IN THE CURRENT STRATEGY
The UNLP, from the beginning of the 2022-2026 administration, began to integrate the
traditional functions of Teaching, Research, Extension,
Technological Transfer and Management, processes and productive structures
that organize activities and service practices through the work of
universities, with the added value of the knowledge originated in our
research and development units.
Under the concept of “production factories”, of base and development
technological, the UNLP provided specific budgets, personnel and resources
scientific and technical, intended for the installation of production processes
in Food, in Vaccines, in Lithium Batteries, in Housing and in Bioinputs.
As has already been said in this document, these organizations come
to systematize many experiences that precede them and provide quality
in the dynamics of processes, in the aggregation of material values and
operational, in experimentation and scientific viability tests. But
meaning no longeris to constitute “pilot” processes but to configure and process
 
raw materials on industrial scales and with systematic and
comprehensive -both from public policies and from some sectors
social and productive system -, adding technologies created and
tested in our scientific centers, articulating with the needs
urgent demands for health, for essential rights against hunger, for
housing, environmentally sustainable energy and the result of our
natural goods.
The work of university students thus becomes a fundamental part of the
everyday life integrated with socio-productive needs, from the
disappearance of the ignominy of hunger to the prospect of sovereignty
national and cultural of our country.
As we already mentioned, today the UNLP is in operational capacity to
production of 150,000 daily servings of dehydrated foods (through
of the PAIS Plant), wooden furniture and housing of social interest of
different characteristics, drug development requested by
public hospitals of the region and the Province (through the Unit
Medicines Producer), as well as in the process to cover the need
of vaccines (52 million annual doses) (through the
Public Production of Vaccines) and lithium batteries.
The PAIS Plant (acronym for Food Plant for Social Integration)
can put food on the table of thousands of Argentine families
dehydrated to prepare stews in a simple, healthy and tasty way. The
Plant has a vegetable dehydration process and a laboratory
quality control of raw materials, final inputs and effluents. HE
located on the grounds of the Ing. Agr. Experimental Station. Julio Hirschhörn, from
60 hectares that depends on the Faculty of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, and
It also has classrooms for teaching, research and
extension, as well as a laboratory. It is advised by a Council formed
by representatives of the Faculties of Engineering, Veterinary Sciences,
Exact Sciences and Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, in addition to
representatives of the Social Council, one of the main promoters of the
initiative based on the needs collected in the 2018 reports and
2019 on access to food in the region.
 
The Training Center also operates on the same premises,
Transfer of Technology, Production and Wood Services. Is about
a forest-industrial center with unique characteristics in the region, which
allows production to be added to the training core of the UNLP. It depends on the
Faculty of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, and has an area
cover of more than 2 thousand square meters that includes sawmill and room
storage, drying oven, sharpening and brushing room, and carpentry workshop.
One of the outstanding characteristics of this university complex is that,
the tasks inherent to wood production, activities are also added
research and training of technicians and professionals.
In the same location, there is also the Biofábrica Escuela where
works in the production of bioinputs that respond to the needs of
the producers of the fruit and horticultural cordon of Greater La Plata, through a
triple impact project. Bio fertilizers, stimulators of
growth, insecticides and fungicides, trying to mitigate the negative impact
of agrochemicals and reduce costs when purchasing them.
On the other hand, in the Center for Innovation and Technology Transfer,
located on diagonal 113 between 64 and 66 (former Sanitary Works dependency),
the machinery and instruments of the first are finishing being installed
Lithium-ion Cells and Batteries Production Unit, (UniLiB) prime r
location of its kind jointly between UNLP, CONICET and Y-TEC.
The construction covers an area of one thousand square meters, in which
all stages of lithium cell and battery manufacturing will work,
energy storage devices valued for having greater
load volume and lighter than other materials, in addition to being
friendly to the environment. Currently, these devices are
imported.
The manufacturing will consist of various stages such as mixing paints,
painting of metal surfaces, laminating, cutting, drying, assembly,
welding, packaging, testing, among others.
As a medium to long-term objective, we want to replicate this plant
in other parts of the national territory, through public agreements -
private.
 
Also, on this property, the Research Center is being installed,
Development, Public Production and Certification of Vaccines, already mentioned.
That is, production is incorporated from full demand and activities at the
set of actions of the UNLP in compliance with its Mission and Statutory functions, in the conviction of social responsibility
integral that we assume as a mandate of the Society that we make up and
We wish you fair and satisfied.
The transformations produced in society and the world economy in
recent times have led to the success, and even the viability, of the
nations depends fundamentally on the quality of knowledge put
at stake in their productive and social processes. This context requires the
availability of trained human resources to access the
knowledge, the production of new knowledge and the promotion of its
specific use. In this framework, public universities face a
important challenge, since knowledge creation, transfer and
The training of these resources cannot be ignored among their missions.
Research activities should be aimed at expanding the frontier of
human knowledge and to promote its practical applications for the benefit
of the society. Thus, the interaction between
research, production, knowledge transfer and
technological linkage. Correlatively, work programs must
commit to the training of human resources with knowledge
broad, solid and up-to-date, both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.
This guarantees the training of young scientists, workers, technologists and
artists of socio-productive and cultural quality according to standards
international. They are called to have a decisive participation in the
social, economic and cultural development of our country and our region.
In the social view that we have of universities today, the
expectation about their role in improving the quality of life of
citizens. In this sense, public universities must play a
active role in local and regional socioeconomic development, promoting
actions that impact the improvement of the quality of life of its inhabitants
and in the social insertion of those who today find themselves postponed or
excluded.

6. SCENARIO OF THE PLAN IN THE CURRENT STRATEGY
The general objective of this university in its administration is to sustain it in
transparent, efficient and effective manner, ensuring management and distribution
socially responsible for economic, human, building and
logistics to meet your fundamental teaching objectives
inclusive, committed research and supportive extension.
Along these lines, specific objectives of the administration are to achieve a
harmonious distribution and orderly execution of your budget and achieve
 
the most appropriate organization of its teaching and teaching staff. Also
are important objectives to achieve its correct functioning, the
implementation of administrative systems and procedures
appropriate, provide the regulatory framework necessary to achieve this, have
the corresponding registration of your assets and achieve coverage
adequate provision of general services and maintenance and cleaning of
movable and immovable property.
It is also an objective to do it in a sustainable way, in accordance with
the goals for sustainable development (SDG2030) of UNESCO, to which
Argentina adhered. For the purposes of its control and policy determination, the
UNLP prepared its carbon footprint, which is one of the most
simple and precise to know the impact that the activity
institutional generates in the environment. This is obtained through measurement
of Greenhouse Gases that allow us to know in greater detail
the different activities that are carried out and which ones emit the most GHG,
enabling the development of specific policies for its reduction, as well as
also anticipate dependence on energies.
For its part, the provision and administration of student services does not

The modernization policy adopted by the Superior Council from

Specific Program, the optimization of internal procedures. To one's own
time, for this, it will be essential to systematically address
professional training actions specialized in the complexity and
particularities of the legal problems of universities.

constantly facing the challenges posed by the relationship of
University and its connection with the environment. The representation of interests

arise from the definition of state policies, on which our
autonomy could be threatened, submerge the management of the Program
Specific in certain margins of uncertainty that requires a constant
readjustment of policies and actions always based on the principles
generalities that illuminate the issue.
Since 2018, the Legal and Technical Prosecretariat has been dedicated to
search, design and implementation of an electronic management system
that responded to the needs of the UNLP and that had the maximum
legal security standards
dica to be able to replace the System of
current files.
Throughout these 4 years, unknowns were cleared up,
decisions and actions were carried out that find us today
with the knowledge and tools necessary to take the steps
definitive for the full implementation of a file solution
integrated electronic.
Having attended the functional and technical meetings of the Commission
SIU Technician, we have been leading actors and protagonists in the
tests of the SUDOCU tool for documentation management in
 
files, a solution that has already been adopted by 17 Institutions
universities and which continues to be constantly updated with the aim of
meet the needs and dimensions of our institution.
The pandemic has been, on the one hand, a brake on the activities planned by the
need to comply with confinement rules, but at the same time it has been a
decision accelerator since forced remote work led to searching
alternatives for working in digital format and gave us the opportunity to
approach intermediate tools that are the transitional step for the
definitive implementation.
On the other hand, the expansion of the use of digital signatures both in the field of
The UNLP and third parties have supported the acceptance of the digital format and
the legal security of the documents and was key in the operation
of the UNLP during periods of closure of establishments by the
pandemic during the years 2020 and 2021. The digital signature allowed the signing of
documents remotely and was part of the procedure of the
granting of titles.
Throughout the course of the previous plan, the tool to be used was defined,
the SIU SUDOCU integrated electronic file system; a was formed
implementation team composed of technicians and users, the
tool, modifications were requested and finally, in 2021, it was put
partially operating within the scope of the Presidency.
Currently the project is in the phase of expanding the tool to
the Faculties and dependencies.
The S IU SUDOCU system has proven to be reliable, robust and secure and will
to be a fundamental ally in the event of having to do part of the work
remote administrative. Among its benefits it contributes to the
depapering, the recovery of file spaces, facilitates the
processing and circulation of files, and the monitoring and traceability of
the same and brings the UNLP up to date regarding what it does to the
administration in the 21st century.
Since the approval and entry into force of Ordinance 295/18 “Regime
of celebration, execution and control of the Agreements” signed or
subscribed by the University, it has been possible to maintain a strict
compliance with the provisions of the aforementioned regulations, which have
 
improved and fully organized the instruments that carry rights
and obligations on the part of this House of Higher Studies.
By virtue of this, it is necessary to deepen control over the agreements to
the purposes of avoiding future contingencies that put assets at risk
university and put us in a place of difficult or adverse defense,
understanding that this is the main role and the objective to fulfill.
To this end, it is essential to systematically approach
specialized professional training in the complexity and particularities of
problems that may arise when controlling the instruments
to be subscribed by the University.
The National University of La Plata, through its Property Directorate
Intellectual Property (DPI), carries out knowledge protection management under
intellectual property systems and develops advisory actions
and training at degree, postgraduate and research units, in all
activities linked to intellectual property (protection and
transfer) of scientific, technological and artistic productions
generated in the university environment. Likewise, it intervenes in the
drafting of guidelines, regulations on the subject and in the negotiation and
drafting of agreements that involve transfer or licenses of
intellectual property.
In recent years it has contributed to the formation of grassroots companies

From your budget:
The UNLP receives an important budget from the National State, voted by
Congress and in recent years there has been a strong recovery of the mass
salary of teachers and Nodocentes, which came to occupy more than 91% of the
budget total. This, added to the permanent need to allocate
greater resources to operating expenses, to the growing demand for
academic programs in general and to the maintenance and growth of
student services, forced an additional effort to ensure that the increases
In these items they will exceed those granted to personnel.
The goal is to recover the proportion of 85% for personnel expenses and 15%
for the rest of the expenses, a proportion established by the corresponding law,
 
and we improved the proposed relationship, the planned budget and
managed for 2022 reached a proportion of 91.8% - 8.7%.
These years, a differential increase was also promoted for the
budget of expenses of the Faculties, Colleges and Welfare programs

operating expense items.
For their part, the extra-budgetary resources managed in these years,

From your staff:
The teaching and teaching staff, as can be seen from the
budget and the essence of university activity is an aspect
fundamental that needs to be maintained in an adequate balance between the
objectives of the institution, the needs demanded by its activities and
the budgetary capacity to satisfy them.
Both cloisters have their national collective agreements.
The Nodocente signed in 2005 and approved in 2006 and the teacher
signed in 2014 and approved in 2015, the one that advances
accelerated in its harmonization with the statute of the UNLP and the
current provisions, providing job stability to all
workers and defining the conditions to advance in their career.
 
The 2021 budget established a staff of 14,390 university teachers,
575 pre-university teachers in addition to 9,222 hours in schools and
3,016 Nodocentes, foreseeing an extrabudgetary item to carry
forward the Nodocent Plant Strengthening Plan, equivalent to the
entry of 300 new workers, in conjunction with a Program Contract
signed with the Secretariat of University Policies for a similar income in
number of workers, making a total of 600 new entries in a
term of 3 years, in addition to 119 officials between authorities and positions of
cabinet.
In the case of teachers, the faculties show a general balance in
the number of teachers and assistants compared to students to attend a
enrollment of about 131,000 undergraduate students and about 5,000 undergraduate students
with free education, beyond internal over and under offers between
chairs of each career and faculty.
The challenge of the coming years is to finish balancing the positions
necessary for teaching classes and achieving even greater growth in
exclusive and semi-exclusive dedications (29.94%) that allow to overcome with
clearance 29.53% (national average proportion 2020) of teachers
researchers, technologists or extensionists with most of their time
work at the university. This will provide us with a teaching community with a
greater involvement with life and the objectives of university development.
For its part, the Nodocent staff was set at 2.6 49 positions for
the UNLP in the general agreements of the Collective Labor Conventions
of the year 2006 between the Ministry of Education through the SPU and the
Argentine Federation of University Workers (FATUN) with a
harmonic distribution and recent dec between categories 7 (incoming) to 1 -

from 2013 to 2015), another for the creation of the Nodocente structure of the
Canal TV – University for a total of 15 positions (1 category 1 position, 3 positions
category 3, 7 category 5 positions and 4 category 7 positions) during the years 201 4
and 2015, 300 category 7 positions in the 2021 budget and a contract

year 2021 according to the agreed pyramid, 3,184 agents (4,609.19 points).
In these years, the UNLP covered with resources demanded by other
activities and services, some 3,016 positions, mostly in high categories,
product centrally of being a plant of marked antiquity and
excessively aged by a measure agreed upon in local parity of the
year 2006. This measure stopped the retirement notices pending the
sanction of a law that ensures 82% mobile for the sector, similar to the
that applies to teachers, since current retirements do not reach that
proportion in the out-of-pocket income of the Nodocent worker.
The passing of the years and the lack of certain expectations that this law will be

incentive equivalent to ten nominal salaries less legal contributions (much
more than ten pocket salaries) for those workers in conditions
to retire (age and years worked) who voluntarily opt for
retirement. In a call with a closed period of 60 days (from 20
October to December 20, 2010) accepted proposal 201 of the
285 employees able to retire, 70% of those who were not
intimated by the conditions established in the joint agreement.
In the following years, and at the request of ATULP, this policy was maintained
through successive reopenings of the system, each one ratifying the marking
interest of the workers in it. As a synthesis of the process described,
In 2015, a particular joint act was signed establishing the conditions and
characteristics of the Program in a stable manner as a sustained policy of the
University and as a consequence, all workers now have a
horizon of certainty in relation to your retirement, a circumstance that allows
point out that there are practically no situations of excess in age
maximum retirement age and the beginning of the respective retirement procedures
harmoniously accompanies the vegetative growth of the plant. In
December 2021, the Nodocente plant is made up of 3,231 agents
(the number of uncovered salaries has been reduced to 47 more than
those recognized by the SPU).
 
This process made it possible to provide greater balance to the distribution of
categories and that of the personnel themselves in the faculties and dependencies,
comply with joint commitments for entering the plant in 2007,
suspended due to an obvious economic impossibility, and restore the
call for competition for entry to the Nodocent career. In this sense,
Every year, jointly, the application of the vacancies generated by
retirement to priority coverage of income positions so necessary for
the growth of the University. Process by which hundreds of new
workers have joined, through competition, the Nodocente s plant in
the entire University.
With the Nodocent Plant Strengthening Plan, founded on the
basis of the strong contribution that the 2021 Budget made to the matter and the
accompaniment of the Contract Triannual Program for three hundred positions per
year signed with the SPU, was reached (as stated in the
preceding paragraphs) the budget balance of the plant of each
faculty, college or agency. At the same time, as the processes of
selection for the entry of the first 400 workers of the Plan were
reserved for contracted workers, this unfair situation was resolved in the
generality of the university. The existing orders of merit have
triannual duration, in order to accompany the development of the Plan in the
following years, without it being necessary to make new calls,
allowing, in addition, to redirect vacancies that naturally leave
producing.
Settled as they have been the issues of volume necessary for each one
of the Nodocentes plants and that of the informal hiring figures
(unavoidable opposite of the previous one), the university is located in
conditions to undertake the detailed study of the model plants for each
faculty or dependency, which within the healthy budget exhibit the
vertical distribution (according to categories) that best suits the
specific functional needs. This process will have to be achieved
through consensus with each faculty and agency and the local joint body,
the time of filling the vacancies that arise.
The objective is to have a Nodocent plant according to the needs of
administration, assistance and maintenance of the various areas of the
 
university, with a balanced and harmonious pyramid at the
responsibilities required of each worker and with the coverage
corresponding budgetary information from the Ministry. This will allow not
divert additional resources vital to other activities
bye, what
allow us to respond to the demands of the system and those made
to the university by the same society.
This requires a trained staff. In this sense, the training
of the Nodocent staff is a process in progress since 1998, when
the first courses began to be taught and which today presents a strong
development, made up of a large annual offering of courses of diverse
nature, aimed at providing the employee with the appropriate elements for their
better performance in the organization. These courses are attended by an average of
500 workers per year, to which are added a university technical degree
with three closed cycle orientations that are already in their fifth cohort, and one
degree articulated with the technical degree that is going through its fourth cohort,
whose graduates seek to provide them with specific postgraduate training.
For its part, the staff and cabinet positions provided for in the
budget[5], should maintain that balance, without distracting
teachers for management and form an organizational chart together with the positions of
stable plant, very rational to cover administrative activities, and
clearly oriented to the management demands of the Strategic Plan.
All UNLP workers, teachers, nodocentes and
civil servants, has social services provided by a Directorate
of Social Services, with its own statute and shared management between the
Presidency and the teaching and Nodocente unions. This address works
as co-insurance for medications and medical services, directs the
UNLP daycare, grants personal loans and loans for low-cost housing
cost and free health, and promotes tourist services in general and in
privately manages the Samay Huasi Museum and Rest House in Chilecito,
La Rioja, promoting and facilitating access for the university community
to one of the symbols of our history and part of the personal heritage of the
founder of the UNLP, Joaquín V. González.
It also has a Health area that assists in emergencies and
referral of cases, with a strong preventive imprint with programs of
 
periodic examinations, vaccinations, promotion of healthy habits,
smoking cessation courses, Basic Life Support training and
sexual education among others.
In addition, it has a risk prevention area, based on management and
permanent training, as well as the improvement of the conditions and environment
work environment, which allowed the UNLP to have the highest
lowest accident rate in the university system, according to reports from the
Superintendence of Occupational Risks.
Likewise, it has at its disposal a General Directorate of Sports to
the entire university community, which is open to the entire university
society. This Directorate needed special attention to put it
in value. The building of known heritage importance has already been recovered
such as the Parthenon, used today as a multifunction space and the changing rooms
In its basement, the Olympic pool was rebuilt and the
new administrative, health care, gym and buffet building. HE
They demolished the useless buildings that left free spaces for the
recreation and sports, also removing old metal structures that
they uselessly partition outer space. The spaces were recovered
green fields and sports playgrounds and an aerobic circuit and a
basketball court with wooden floor. The square was rebuilt again
in front of the Parthenon and an Olympic athletics track was built, putting
value the existing one.
  
Of administrative systems and procedures:
The UNLP must have systems for its administration and management that
establish for all users and claimants, the procedures and
adequate and transparent rules that provide information in real time
on the progress of the processes, having the necessary tools
and updated technologies to keep the community informed[6]. This
It also becomes essential to make decisions, design strategies
and direct the proposed policies.
Throughout these years, a large number of
computer systems for administration, with their manuals
administrative procedure and information systems to streamline
 
procedures and consultations, prepared from debating and agreeing on them among
the administrators of faculties, colleges and agencies. However,
to achieve the objectives set and optimize both the management of the
personnel, administration and budget execution including
purchases, as well as academic activities, it was necessary to implement
full operation of university computer systems
unified SIU: administrative management Pilagá - together with purchasing Diaguita
and of person
nal Mapuche - and Guaraní academic management - along with that of
statistics of Araucano students and libraries -, a process in which
was able to move forward with a series of staggered partial implementations that
It allows us to use them fully starting in 2013.
These systems are complemented by other computer systems
developed by the UNLP such as the Income System (SIPU), Application for
Scholarships, Degree System, Library Management System integrated with
Guaraní access and information (MERAN), Medical Folder System and
Medical Examinations, Online Asset Certification System, the
UNLP portal (Choique), the UNLP school management system
(Kimkelén) among other services for students, teachers, administrators and
authorities. It should be noted that several of these systems have been shared
with other National Universities and that in many cases they work with
free license (GPL).
On the other hand, the period of Social, Preventive and Mandatory Isolation
imposed a unique challenge on the university when it came to sustaining the
operation of its administrative procedures, traditionally
recorded on paper. Generalization and training in the use of
digital signature[8 ] and the rules issued for the processing of
online, they allowed administrative work to be carried out
with normality and full legal security and validity from the homes of
each. In parallel, and by natural effect of the restrictions derived from
the pandemic, the development process by the SIU Consortium was accelerated
of the SUDOCU electronic record system that our university
adopted by resolution of the Superior Council, counting as of December 2021
with 6.7 70 completely electronic files being processed in the new
system. Using these tools, all the work carried out during the
 
ASPO period may continue in digital format, without the need for
go back to the paper support again. The challenge of the hour consists
in advancing its progressive implementation for new procedures
until completing the digitization of the administrative task.
Regarding the administrative management itself, the constant monitoring of the
areas of the organization allows the optimization of circuits
procedural and communicational and in the case of the Presidency, the
adaptation of spaces and the provision of adequate equipment allows
constant improvement – an example is the change in the construction of
titles implemented in 2020, going from an artisanal system to a
fully digital system with substantially improved security
superior and much faster preparation and making available to the
graduate -.
Due to this monitoring, the need clearly arises to shore up
constantly the role that the General Directorates of the Presidency have
as governing bodies of certain administrative procedures
specials. This role is conceived as basically made up of five
aspects that must be developed harmoniously:
1. Preparation of third-level regulations (under the HCS Ordinances
and the President's Resolutions) that unify operational criteria,
standardize interpretations based on the experiences collected and
integrate aspects not expressly resolved.
2. Permanent advice, both to the respective services located in
the Faculties and Dependencies that are referenced with them, as well as towards the
Higher Authorities.
3. Constant training for workers who perform in the
respective services so that they have a finished and updated management of
the rules and procedures.
4. Continuous and timely supervision of the way in which the procedures are
developed to be able to correct errors in time and propose improvements in the
design of rules and procedures.
5. Generation of specialized areas of administrative debate, in which
which those responsible for all the services involved in
certain procedures can share experiences and visions that
 
They can then be synthesized in a constant reform and improvement of the standards
and procedures.
At the same time, it is understood that contemporary dynamics impose on
public administrations the constant need to apply the advances of
computing and telecommunications to the administrative management of a
intelligent mode, which tends to maximize resource efficiency
applied to administration (in order to enhance its
application to the specific and distinctive functions of the University) without
sacrifice of legal security and the constant effort to support the most
high standards of transparency. It is therefore appropriate to emphasize the
path taken towards an administrative criterion inspired by the
paperless concepts, digital self-management
and open government in
combination with the traditional administration safeguards. Process
that must be approached as inclusive of the management of agreements that
facilitate not only the internal processes of the University, but also
those procedures and procedures in which external organizations intervene.
Along these lines, and updating our standards and procedures to
always maintain the highest standards of transparency and exemplarity
procedural, Ordinances 293 "Regime of access to the
information, protection of personal data and transparency", 294
"Effectiveization of salary benefits", 295 "Regime of celebration,
execution and control of agreements", 296 "Rendering of subsidies", 297
"Recruitment regime" and 300 “Digital diploma regime”. All
them by modernizing, making transparent and increasing the controls that are
exercise on different key aspects of daily management, seeking to
own time simplify the procedures so that the measures of
security and transparency do not affect effectiveness, speed and efficiency; but
which, thanks to new technologies, are virtuously combined.
Facilitate and make more agile the execution of spending in Faculties, Colleges and
dependencies, make the procedures for researchers less cumbersome,
teachers, nodocentes and students and be up to date on the results of the
resources received and the procedures necessary for a
transparent and effective administration, should be a constant concern
and central.
 
  
From the regulatory framework:
In recent years, the administration was provided with appropriate ordinances
and the resolutions necessary for its best functioning, covering
structural delays in the matter. For its part, the established mechanics of
permanent discussion and periodic and systematic review with
administrators of the Presidency and of Faculties and Colleges, we are
providing the necessary arguments for new provisions. It's a
area in which much progress was made, but with a permanent demand for
new updates.
  
From internal control:
At the beginning of these pages it was stated that the administration and management of
the logistical needs of this entire group, acquires relevance for the
compliance with the proposed objectives. Consequently, the role of control
internal practice that the institution practices is transcendent to guarantee the
transparency of its execution.
Said control is carried out through specific procedures and tasks that
allow you to carry out an examination and/or evaluation independently,
objective, systematic and comprehensive of the prevailing functioning in the
organization, involving its operations and compliance with the
financial, legal and management responsibilities. All this in order to
generate an opinion about its effectiveness, efficiency and economy and the
possible separations that may occur, providing advice to
through recommendations to those responsible to generate solutions to the
detected problems.
This is reflected in Audit Reports prepared by the General Audit Office, the
which are communicated to the authorities of Faculties, Dependencies and the
University to take the appropriate measures, carrying out
during the months of June and December a follow-up to verify if
They complied with these measures. It can also be seen in the making of
various tasks: intervention in the certificates of works before payment,
intervention in the payments for debt consolidation that must be made by the
University, awareness of summary resolutions, etc.
 
To this end, the UNLP has its Long-Term Audit Plan (PALP) or audit cycle.
audit, which includes all of the audit activities of the
entity and within that framework, each year it prepares the Annual Audit Plan (PAA).
Audit Projects are chosen from the list of categorized projects
because they were considered in a general way in the PALP, in order of
priority and for the time they take, beyond making reports
punctually requested in situations that require them.
  
From the property registry:
The real estate assets of the UNLP, after years of management
focused on resolving old delays, its registration is normalized

Another notable aspect is the definitive regularization of the Measurement Plan
and Division and the registration of said Plan and the domain in the name of the
UNLP in the Property Registry of the Province of La Rioja, the Museum and House
of Samay Huasi Rest. This was done through an agreement with the
 
Government of said Province, which allows specifying the domain of the
University on a total area of 64 hectares.
It is also worth mentioning the arduous efforts underway to give in
community property to the Mbya Guaraní indigenous peoples, the Reserve

Of the services:

Regarding the consumption of services, a program of

Regarding fluids, water consumption at UNLP has meters that

It is also possible to improve and rationalize electricity consumption by
installation of a set of transformers that allow taking advantage of the
medium voltage network, guaranteeing greater stability and lower cost,
both fundamental not only for general demands but for
supply the technological equipment necessary for research
and the transfer. In addition, progress is being made in the use of energy
alternatives such as the solar screens that were installed at the Faculty of
IT (which saves around 10% of its total consumption
 
energetic). The use of sensors and timers is being studied to reduce the
idle switching on of lights, stoves and air conditioners.
The use of natural gas, mainly for heating, is being tried
change to other safer, more efficient and economical alternatives such as
electric power.
A system of IP exchanges was implemented that allows for more efficient use
and economical landline telephone service in the UNLP, minimizing
the cost of this service. In mobile telephony we contract closed networks
with free numbers (fleets) and solidarity use of free minutes, which
allowed a drastic reduction in cost.
For the use of the Internet, fiber optics and wireless networks were provided to
all the Faculties and Units of the UNLP, and although it has a high cost
annual fixed, is the minimum possible to guarantee agile and efficient use of the
Network for administration, teaching and research, opening a
still unexplored field of new utilities.
Finally, the case of preventive surveillance of property and people
in Faculties, Colleges and agencies, which was implemented in the last
years as a complementary activity of the own personnel that in hours
additional performs this function after having passed through examinations
psychophysical tests and an intense training process, gave a result
satisfying. About 350 people, the vast majority of them workers

transit routes called safe corridors, LED lighting of the
pedestrian circuits inside and outside the UNLP premises, mechanisms
that the Faculties and Colleges themselves implement in their buildings and grounds
and permanent promotion within the university community of behaviors
aimed at prevention.
 
  
From institutional communication:
Regarding communication processes, the UNLP has a series of
institutional, organizational, corporate communication devices,
informative and dialogic. Among these devices is the Web Portal, a communication channel
official communication of all the activities generated by the UNLP, which has
with 4 million daily accesses.
In the social media ecosystem, participation in
Facebook, with almost 15 million readings or interactions with publications
of the page and 208,331 followers. Meanwhile, on Twitter it has about
4,000,000 readings and 214,900 followers who give their opinions, demand and receive
daily information from the UNLP. On Instagram, 101,000 have already been reached
followers and more than 9,000,000 impressions/reads of the posts in the
Social network. Finally, the LinkedIn network has more than 20,000 contacts and
153,756 followers of the UNLP Page, where a reach of
more than 1,700,000 readings of his publications.
In 2019, the website specialized in Communication was also incorporated
Public Science https://investiga.unlp.edu.ar/, as a tool
communication especially aimed at making scientific production visible
that is generated in the different centers, laboratories and institutes of the UNLP.
This portal has 250,000 visitors per year and became a portal

specialized.
It also has a Press Service, with its own production and
permanent university news.
Likewise, the area is responsible for the organization of the traditional Expo
University that is held annually in Pasaje Dardo Rocha since
year 2002 to disseminate among applicants to enter the UNLP the careers
undergraduate and postgraduate courses and the various aspects of university life, with a
notable call, increasingly important.

Finally, the work of the Visual Communication Department stands out,
responsible since 2000 for the coordination and standardization of the
applications of the UNLP brand and the production of graphic pieces and
digital issued by the areas of the Presidency.
 
Of student benefits:
UNLP provides strong coverage of benefits and services to
undergraduate and graduate students to facilitate their access and progress
academic, and graduation from the institution.
In recent years, progress has been made in this direction, launching and making
grow the University Dining Hall, the Student Hostel, the Educational Ticket
Free, health coverage, different scholarships according to the
specific needs detected in the student population, the policies
of income promotion and a structure for recreation, culture, sports
and other uses of free time that strengthen the possibilities of
accompaniment and adaptation to the university environment.
The value of the dining room ticket has a universal subsidy for students
60% and a 100% subsidy - free - for those students who join
are in vulnerable socioeconomic conditions. They use the dining room
around 10,000 students per day and can access the service without
subsidy for teachers and non-teachers.
The University Hostel operates on a property that consists of three modules
fully finished housing. The maximum capacity is 196
rooms, which we aspire to have completely available in the year
2023.
In 2015, through the UNLP Management, unanimous approval was achieved in
both provincial Legislative Chambers of Law 14,735 of the Ticket
Free Student for all educational levels.
The Health System has coverage for students without social work,
including medical, dental, psychological care, medications,
clinical analyzes and glasses. These benefits are articulated with the system
of local and regional health guaranteeing provision.
 
The students have the Dining Hall scholarship, financial aid, and Bicycle

student tenants; Connectivity Scholarship and Your PC to study.
On the other hand, there are also Special Scholarships which are
determined according to the needs of the student.
The UNLP Scholarship System is completed with dissemination and articulation
permanent with the scholarships managed in the National Programs.
In order to strengthen university identity and student integration,

is to democratize information and that all people who want to carry out
a university degree, rest assured that the UNLP is public, free
and develops strategies to achieve this goal.
 
Think about the buildings and spaces of the UNLP
The UNLP has numerous urban and rural properties in which
carries out its academic, extension, scientific, technological and
artistic.
As for those in which the buildings of their faculties are located
and dependencies, these are located in various parts of the city and the
region, although in general terms the University has two points of
reference: one surrounding and integrating the so-called Platense Forest, a
regional recreational park of 60 hectares. strategically located in the
convergence of the three municipal districts of the region: La Plata, Berisso
and Ensenada; and another in the center of the city of La Plata.
 
The UNLP in the Forest is distributed in five regular properties
dimensions that are called West Forest, Central, North, East and Forest
of Berisso Campo August 6 and in the Center, in different locations in
around Plaza Rocha and the Center itself.
As can be seen from this description, it is not a c institution
oncentred
on a Campus, but integrated into the regional urban and social environment,
characteristic that identifies it, defining La Plata as a city
university, a profile that is promoted to extend to the region. Your students,
Nodocentes and teachers live and coexist with a community of which
They are part of the most diverse aspects of their daily lives.
In recent years, the UNLP has progressed on that idea, transcending its
location the limits of the municipality of La Plata, advancing with facilities
in the Ensenada parties (after intense efforts, in 2010
completed the transfer by the Province of the so-called Bosque Norte

called Campo 6 de Agosto, a complex process that is still underway
in 2020 with marked progress.
In its idea of a university integrated into the urban environment, articulated with its vision
regional, proposed and implemented the operation of a university train
from the current central station on 1 and 44 to the vicinity of the Hospital
 
Gral. San Martín Polyclinic on 1 and 72, in a short 5 km route on
existing roads in good condition, with a hostel that supplies the Faculty of
Architecture and Urbanism, another stop the group of Informatics, Psychology and
Humanities and Cs. of Education and the Faculty of Cs. Astronomical and
Geophysics, another inn from the Cs group. Naturals and Museum, Cs. medical,
Classrooms and Laboratories of Cs. Exactly, Cs. Agronomic and Forestry and Cs.
Veterinarians, and another that supplies Journalism and Social Communication, in addition
of the Scientific and Technological University Center and an important group of
research institutes. The other inns of the project in
operation are located on diagonal 73 and ring road and on 1 and 72 at a
block from the General San Martín Polyclinic.
In 2020 we began the process to extend the University Train to
the Gambier workshops at 52 and 131 adding the hostels
Circunvalación, Meridiano V, San Juan de Dios Hospital and Gambier. Expanding
the route another 6 km. With the intention of transforming the property of the
old Gambier railway workshops – 32 hectares. - in a large Center
Productive University of Innovation and Transfer, thus linking everything
the university system and adding more kilometers of urban travel to
provide a public service to the entire Community. In 2022 the
works of the second stage of the University Train to the San Juan Hospital
of God.
The University Rondín was also launched, with free tickets for
students, a 4-bus line that runs through the faculties of the
Centers and Forests, even entering the BIM, with a stop
designed as a safe point in the heart of the property with a large hostel and
another great inn in front of the Faculty of Medical Sciences on 60th Avenue.
In addition, a set of special vehicles was put into operation
called Ecobus first suitable and then built by the Faculty
of Engineering, to take students and workers from the buildings of the
Academic Units at urban bus stops. These microphones for
14 people are electric and run on lithium batteries developed by
the UNLP itself. One already works in the Forest for the Faculty of Sciences
Astronomical and Geophysical Sciences and the Museum of Natural Sciences, bringing
students to Calle 1 and the Parador de Medicina and another that runs along Calles 50 and
 
52 between 1 and 120 that serves the Annex School and the Computer Science faculties,
Psychology and Humanities and Educational Sciences.
Its building assets total around 486,161 m2 in March 2022 and as of
a rigorous works plan and an intense resource management process against
to a receptive State at all levels, was able to recover and grow
notably in recent years, making it possible, from
of the
recovery of its old buildings and the construction of new ones, the
resolution of a serious infrastructure deficit that made dictation difficult

the new demands that arise from the Faculties that are based there. This
pedestrian should be completed with a meandering aerobic circuit that
tour the green areas of the property, already landscaped for the recreational use of
students and workers, to which accessory lighting will have to be added
and equipment. It is thought that the central pedestrian should also be
circulated by an ecological vehicle that transports teachers and students to
throughout the property, and that its current lighting should be provided by
 
alternative energies, mainly solar, developed by the company itself

A contribution to the management of the territorial development of the Region
As reflected in these lines, the National University of La Plata
occupies a fundamental place in the development process of the Region. He
knowledge that educates, that transfers, produces and exchanges is increasingly
Furthermore, the alternative of progress with clearer equity for this territory and
their community.
We have already stated clearly that social production (food, housing,
medicines, vaccines and energy) and promotion of national alternatives
(lithium) does not only make up an agenda of statements, but also translates into
infrastructure, equipment, effective production and work as a pillar
more of the development of our university, along with teaching,
research and extension, forming the integral cycle of training
our students and graduates, of the production of knowledge
oriented to the priority and strategic needs of our country and the
constant integration with our society in each of its demands,
needs and expectations.
Our concern for human rights, for the defense of
quality of our environment, due to social problems, are reflected
in our management structure clearly.
However, we think that our participation in an agenda that
look for the progress of our community in the particularities of a
region with large infrastructure plans pending for many years
decades, it is a responsibility that we have to assume as our own,
listening to the complaints and joining the efforts that our
 
community and its institutions ensure that the central ideas for
improve our situation and multiply opportunities come to fruition.
The idea of occupying and promoting the occupation of urban voids in the hands
of the State in important uses to prioritize our localities and
neighborhoods is a central aspect.
In this stage we manage the reactivation of the Railway property in
Gambier (31.6 hectares between streets 131 to 140 and from street 52 to street
56), articulating effective railway activities with the aspirations of the
Government of the Province to decentralize and concentrate part of its
administration, transferring activities that today operate in countless
rented buildings and adding the growth of our university in Los
Hornos/Sa n Carlos, southern towns that grew vigorously.
Our contribution proposes bringing annexes from our schools, from our
School of Trades, university extension activities, careers
our faculties, research and transfer laboratories and companies
clean technology-based projects driven by our graduates
entrepreneurs from the most diverse branches of knowledge.
We want to contribute to the development of this area, today with more population than
Berisso or Ensenada (where we have already grown with a very
positive of our contribution to the development of these brother Parties). That's why
and with the same purpose we also want to participate in the use of the land
empty spaces of the Elizalde Railway Station, now in disuse (5 hectares between the
streets 76 to 81 and from street 29 to street 30).
And we want to advance in the negotiations with the Ministry of Defense of the
Nation to enhance the scientific activity of the Communications Battalion
601, property of the Argentine Army (106.1 hectares between the Camino Parque
Centenario to 18th Street and from Arroyo Rodríguez to 476th Street),
adding to our Public University in multiple academic activities
and scientific research and technological development that consolidate the
national development and the sovereignty of our country advancing with
own knowledge on topics of strategic interest to our
progress.
In these three issues, transcendent for the city and the region, we are
working.
 
We also work on the recovery of disused urban roads,
fundamental to complement the city's public transport and the
region.
The University Train, which, as we already mentioned, we strongly manage
and the Central Railway Station of 1 and 2 has been operating since 2013.

extension to the San Juan de Dios Hospital inn at 72 and 25 with 3
intermediate hostels that will be operational in 2023 and we are
advancing in the management of the agreement with the Ministry of Transportation of the
Nación and Ferrocarriles Argentinos to extend it to 137 and 52, carrying the
last station to the center of Los Hornos, with 3 other intermediate stops.
We also moved forward with the signing of the initiation agreement to restore the
railway to Berisso and Ensenada from the use of the independent branch
called Río Santiago, so that the University Train connects the Station
Central 1 and 44 with the Central Dock Station, bordering the Port.
In road works we are managing with AUBASA, in
provincial dam that
manages the Buenos Aires -La Plata Highway, the descents contemplated in
the original project at City Bell and 520th Avenue, essential to alleviate
the vehicular use of the La Plata access roundabout on diagonal 74, in
particular to cargo transportation.
Along these lines, we are managing with National Roads the continuation of
the works of the current highway from diagonal 74 to avenue 60 to give it
better access to Berisso and Ensenada and to generate an adequate road
for the transit of trucks with containers from Puerto La Plata to their
connection with the Perón Highway, the AMBA and CABA road complex.
We also work with Highways of the Province of Buenos Aires so that
The connection of the Port and the Buenos Aires-La Plata highway with Route 6 will be
make along 90th Avenue, generating another connection, not only to the Port but also to
the city and the region with route 36 and highway route 2.
As always, we will manage and join each initiative that
facilitate the functioning and development of our region.
