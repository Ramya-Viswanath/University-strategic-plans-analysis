Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 3LAND ACKNOWLEDGMENT
We recognize that many Indigenous Nations have longstanding 
relationships with the territories upon which York University 
campuses are located that precede the establishment of 
York University. York University acknowledges its presence 
on the traditional territory of many Indigenous Nations. 
The area known as Tkaronto has been care taken by the 
Anishinabek Nation, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and the Huron-Wendat. It is now home to many First Nation, Inuit 
and Métis communities. We acknowledge the current treaty 
holders, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. This 
territory is subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt 
Covenant, an agreement to peaceably share and care for the 
Great Lakes region. 
FOREWORD
For the past several years, countries have faced the 
tremendous task of managing a global pandemic with the 
impacts of the pandemic still widely being felt. From reimaging 
health care systems to facing new realities such as increased 
remote work and the acceleration of the digitalization of 
our economy, the issues we face are wide and far-reaching. 
While the world is still in the midst of tackling the COVID-19 
pandemic and adapting to the many socio-economic changes 
that it has brought, the pandemic has mobilized researchers 
at York to help lead and contribute to the global effort to 
overcome the pandemic by investigating the immediate 
impact of COVID-19, as well as the long-term implications for 
society. Moreover, York researchers are also tackling a myriad 
of other salient local and global developments –from the war 
in Ukraine sparking the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the 
Second World War to issues of affordability in Canada – our 
researchers are addressing a wide range of pressing issues to 
drive new insights. 
As a comprehensive research-intensive institution, York has a 
proud tradition of interdisciplinary scholarship and the pursuit 
of discovery and innovation. Its commitment to excellence 
brings together a rich diversity of perspectives with a strong 
sense of social responsibility that is making a difference to 
the world around us. Supporting the University Academic 
Plan 2020-2025: Building a Better Future , this Strategic 
Research Plan 2023-2028: Knowledge for the Future: From 
Creation and Discovery to Application lays out a vision for 
accelerating the growth and supporting the development of 
our research, scholarship and creative activity over the next 
five years. It is a plan that seeks to reaffirm and advance York’s 
commitment to research excellence and to the development 
and application of new knowledge to create positive change 
in our local and global communities. This plan showcases 
the depth and breadth of research at York – research that is 
innovative; advances critical inquiry and scientific discovery; 
examines our beliefs and perceptions; and seeks to impact 
the social, cultural and economic development of our country 
and beyond. The York community has shown an enthusiastic response 
to the planning process and provided valuable feedback 
highlighting their aspirations for scholarly research in the 
context of the overall academic mandate of the University. In 
this plan, these aspirations provide guidance for the growth 
and development of research at York over the next five years. 
By implementing this research plan, we aspire to create 
opportunities for the entire University to engage in dialogue on 
emerging big ideas that have the potential to lead to positive 
change on a large scale. By proactively inciting discussion 
on emerging issues of societal importance, including the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), involving leading 
minds representing a broad range of expertise, perspectives 
and experience, we remain committed to enhancing the 
well-being of the communities we serve.
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 4EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Led by the Office of the Vice-President Research and 
Innovation (VPRI) and guided by a dedicated Strategic 
Research Plan Advisory Committee (see Appendix A), the 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028: Knowledge for the 
Future: From Creation and Discovery to Application was 
developed through a broad process of collegial engagement 
with our academic community. This plan lays out a vision for 
accelerating the growth and supporting the development of 
our research, scholarship and creative activity over the next 
five years and can be read as four sections. 
The first section of this plan highlights York University’s 
mission, research vision and research excellence, with 
decolonizing research and diversity and inclusivity in research 
and scholarship underscored as two key pillars of research 
excellence at the University.
The second section of the plan showcases the depth and 
breadth of research at York, which is reflected by the 
University’s six intersecting areas of research strength: 
• Advancing Fundamental, Discovery and Theoretical 
Research and Scholarship 
• Illuminating Cultures and Cultivating Creativity 
• Building Healthy Lives, Communities and Reimagining 
Futures 
• Reaching New Horizons in Science, Technology and Society 
• Pursuing Justice, Equity and Sustainability: From Urban 
Dynamics to Global Challenges
• Elevating Entrepreneurship Through Socially Responsible 
Innovation 
The research, scholarship and creative activity within each 
theme are informed by disciplines but are inherently inter- and 
transdisciplinary in their representation and application. These themes reflect areas of research in which we are 
demonstrating national and international leadership and are 
expected to continue to grow and excel over the next five 
years.
At the same time, there are a select number of more 
focused areas where we see specific opportunities to further 
accelerate research growth and success. The third section 
highlights six areas of opportunity that are timely and provide 
particular opportunity to build York’s research success. Each 
of the following foci transects our areas of thematic strength, 
bringing in expertise from around the University:
• Digital Cultures and Disruptive Technologies 
• Healthy Communities, Equity and Global Well-being 
• Indigenous Futurities
• Climate Action for a Sustainable Planet
• Social Justice, Peace and Equitable Relations
• Inter- and Transdisciplinary Research Innovation 
The final section of the plan outlines the University’s 
commitment to a strategic combination of broadly based 
and focused investments to enable research success – this 
includes continued efforts and investments to support 
the development of all innovation opportunities, through 
supporting industry and community engagement and 
partnerships, knowledge mobilization, entrepreneurship 
and commercialization. In five years, we expect to have 
strongly advanced our reputation and trajectory as an 
internationally leading, research-intensive, comprehensive 
Canadian university, making a difference in communities and 
improving society.

to excellence in research and scholarship in all its forms. 
Informed by a strong commitment to shared values, including 
the promotion of social justice, diversity, equity, the public 
good, social engagement and global citizenship, we believe that intensive engagement in research is a core institutional 
value that permeates the fabric of the University, and it is this 
foundation on which York’s vibrant and exciting academic 
environment is built. This plan focuses on advancing the 
frontiers of knowledge through scholarship and research of the 
highest quality. This is reaffirmed through York’s commitment 
embedded in its mission, vision and values .R
ESEARCH EXCELLENCE
From its inception to our present standing as a diverse and 
comprehensive research and teaching institution, York has 
focused not only on new discoveries and the creation of new
knowledge but also on how this knowledge can be used to 
benefit cultures and societies as broadly as possible. Research  
at York has seen remarkable growth, with an expansion of 
world-leading research, scholarship and creative activity in
the fine arts, social sciences, humanities, education, law,  
science and business. This is accompanied by rapidly growing 
leadership in health and engineering that is broadening
and deepening York’s engagement with and impact on our 
communities.
York researchers have played key roles in many of the 
important discoveries and influential scholarship of the past 
six decades. Some examples include space instrumentation 
for the exploration of Mars; impacting the way we think
about youth homelessness; understanding the changes 
brought about by colonial expansion on Indigenous societies; 
advancing understanding of biological and computer vision; 
studying the formation and development of language policy; 
generating new insights into brain development in children; 
examining lifelong learning linked to brain performance; 
encouraging civic dialogue through performance and public 
art; working to improve the global plight of refugees; shaping 
future thought on suburbanization and today’s ecological 
crisis; mapping the spread of infectious diseases through 
mathematical modelling; and using law to address social 
inequalities.
York scholars have achieved the highest recognition in their 
fields and follow in the tradition of our many accomplished  
scholars. They include over 150 Royal Society Fellows and 
new Members of the College, and 25 Distinguished Research 
Professors. York scholars have been inducted and named
as Killam Prize winners, Guggenheim Fellows, Humboldt 
Fellows, Fulbright Scholars and Trudeau Foundation Fellows. 
They have been recognized with the E.W.R. Steacie Fellow-
ships (now known as the Arthur B. McDonald Fellowships) andGovernor General’s Awards and have received a range of 
disciplinary honorifics and prizes for their books, lectures 
and other scholarly achievements. York’s allocation of 38 
Canada Research Chairs, which are complemented by over 
50 York Research Chairs and over 30 named Chairs and 
Professorships, demonstrates the University’s support for 
its faculty and their research excellence across disciplines. 
The work of our scholars enriches the teaching, research 
and overall learning environment for our students – our next 
generation of leaders and thinkers.
Notably, research at York is strongly engaged internationally 
and has significant global impact. York boasts some of the 
world’s top researchers contributing to over 150 topic areas 
with nearly 35% of our publications in the top 10% of journals 
worldwide. Ranked prominently within the influential Times 
Higher Education Impact Rankings, York places 33rd in 
the world in meeting the United Nations SDGs, positioning 
York among the top 6% of universities worldwide for the 
last several years. Further, over the last 10 years, York has 
been top ranked among Ontario universities for our global 
collaborative research publications. Within the next five years, 
we expect to increase the scope of our international leadership 
recognition by at least 10% and significantly increase our 
rankings across all topic areas.
The York community understands the importance of 
translating discovery into action and seeks to engage the 
world around us in collaborative, participatory and partnered 
research that is inclusive, builds long-term relationships 
and brings tangible benefits to the communities with which 
we work. York has seized on these opportunities and has 
made long-term investments in supporting participatory 
and collaborative research and scholarship that reaches 
from Toronto and its region, across Canada and around the 
world. Currently, York has over 300 active partnerships with 
international institutions that enables the movement and 
exchange of researchers and trainees.
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 6Leading examples of the international reach of York’s research 
include the York-led Refugee Research Network bringing 
together Canadian and international scholars in the study 
of refugee and forced migration issues; a York-based global 
partnership of feminist urban researchers studying, educating 
and advocating around women’s livelihoods in eight cities 
in the Global South; utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and 
data science models in helping to predict viral transmission 
of disease and mitigate new infections in the developing 
world; the establishment of Connected Minds: Neural & 
Machine Systems for a Healthy, Just Society for creating an 
international hub of expertise in socially responsible research 
and technology to optimize societal benefits and mitigate risks 
of human-machine interactions; the United Nations Economic 
Commission for Europe (UNECE) establishing the Toronto 
Centre of Excellence on Youth Homelessness Prevention 
at York to assess the state of youth homelessness and 
prevention in the 56 member states of the UNECE. Similarly, 
some significant health and science projects are driven by 
research collaborations with international partners, such as 
our partnership with Qatar University and other partners in 
leading the development of the first International Cardiac 
Rehabilitation Registry program; and our long-standing 
collaborations with the European Organization for Nuclear 
Research (CERN), NASA, and the European Space Agency.
We enhance our impact locally and globally through the 
graduates we prepare and the research, scholarship and 
creative activity we create. York takes an integrative approach 
to teaching and research - undergraduate and graduate 
students, as well as postdoctoral fellows, enjoy the active 
mentorship of internationally recognized scholars, and are 
provided access to cutting-edge research infrastructure and an 
exciting and engaged environment for the pursuit of discovery. 
York hosts one of the largest cohorts of graduate students in 
the country, and York’s graduate and postdoctoral fellows are 
key drivers of the University’s research excellence and scholarly 
success – from trainees to professor emeriti, we are committed 
to the continued support of researchers across the lifespan. 
York has a strong commitment to supporting our continued 
growth and application of our research, scholarship and 
creative activity through focused planning documents, 
including the UAP 2020-2025. As emphasized in its “Six 
Priorities for Action,” the UAP describes the continued growth 
and acceleration in our research, scholarship and creative 
activity as key to the overall success of the institution. 
Furthermore, the UAP makes strong commitments to 
expanding the success of research at York over the next five 
years, with a focus on deepening York’s research contributions 
in addressing complex and pressing issues, such as those 
highlighted by the United Nations SDGs. Additionally, 
York’s Open Access Policy reinforces our commitment to 
the democratization of knowledge by making our research 
widely accessible through an open access repository. As the 
importance and prominence of research, scholarship and creative activity continue to intensify at York, this Strategic 
Research Plan provides the next level of detail in articulating 
our strategy for translating our research ambition into 
successful outcomes and contributions.
COMMITMENT TO DECOLONIZING 
RESEARCH
York is committed to diversity of thought and strives to pursue 
inclusive excellence by decolonizing research and ensuring 
that our researchers are committed to a global mindset, 
ethical judgment, and critical integration of diverse ideas and 
worldviews. Founded in 1959 on the traditional territory of 
the Anishinabek Nation, The Haudenosaunee Confederacy 
and the Huron-Wendat, York acknowledges our colonial roots 
and recognizes that decolonizing research requires intentional 
examination of the ongoing colonial processes, practices and 
Western ways of thinking that continue to delegitimize and 
devalue Indigenous knowledges and Indigenous peoples at 
York University. York values the achievements of Indigenous 
scholars and students in research, teaching and learning. We 
are committed to addressing ongoing barriers deeply rooted 
in colonial practices and policies that govern research policies 
and procedures (including, for example, grant administration, 
ethical review and grant adjudication), that may conflict with 
Indigenous research methodologies. All peoples have greatly 
benefited from Indigenous knowledges, languages and 
ways of knowing and being. Accordingly, York continues to 
interrogate our ways of functioning critically and systematically 
in all aspects of the academy that inadvertently or otherwise 
interfere with our commitment to supporting, recognizing and 
valuing Indigenous knowledges and Indigenous scholars. 
Furthermore, York’s emphasis on interdisciplinarity provides 
national and international leadership in the promotion of new 
approaches to research and scholarship. In particular, York 
is committed to working with Indigenous communities (First 
Nations, Inuit and Métis) and York-based Indigenous scholars 
to deepen our understandings of respectful forms of research 
engagement, development and application. The UAP affirms 
York’s commitment to the Indigenous Framework in its “Six 
Priorities for Action,” including building stronger relationships 
with Indigenous communities. In the Winter 2023 term, the 
Office of the Vice-President Research and Innovation (VPRI) 
will launch the first fully Indigenous Research Ethics Board, 
led and advised by Indigenous members, with the aim of 
providing oversight and ethics review into research involving 
Indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit and Métis). To further 
support Indigenous members of York’s community, this plan 
identifies Indigenous Futurities as an opportunity to advance 
social, cultural, artistic, policy, legal, economic and justice 
areas that holistically shape Indigenous experience. York 
remains committed to building community partnerships in 
research and to facilitating research that respects Indigenous 
approaches to knowledge and learning. 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 7COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND 
INCLUSIVITY IN RESEARCH AND 
SCHOLARSHIP
This plan reaffirms York’s long-standing commitment to the 
values of equity, diversity, inclusion and social justice. York 
believes that our diverse community, research excellence and 
commitment to collaboration facilitates responses to complex 
challenges that serve the public good and create positive 
change in the communities we serve. We acknowledge that 
creating positive change requires that all members of our 
diverse community are equally valued and recognized and 
feel a sense of belonging, common purpose and shared 
responsibility to enrich and support each other’s work. 
As we build on our strengths across areas of research, 
scholarship and creative activity, we recognize that the nature 
of our respectful relationships with each other is paramount 
for our ongoing success. As such, we aim to nurture an 
equitable and inclusive environment where all members of the 
York community experience a strong sense of belonging and 
well-being. This includes cultivating equitable and inclusive 
research environments in which the intersecting social 
relations of power are continually analyzed and challenged. 
This also includes meaningful and genuine research 
partnerships with communities in the cities and urban regions 
of which we are a part. 
Meanwhile, York is continuing to create and sustain diverse 
research teams and encourage research programs in 
equity-deserving communities. This involves the continued 
support of scholarship for equity-deserving groups, the 
Dimensions Charter, and the advocacy and work related to 
Tri-Council funding and programs. As outlined in the UAP, 
we are also continuing our actions to support reconciliation 
and transformation through our Indigenous Framework and 
intensifying our systematic efforts to embed human rights, 
equity, diversity and inclusion training across the University. 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 8RESEARCH AREAS OF STRENGTH: COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH 
ENGAGEMENT ACROSS THE INSTITUTION
York is providing nationally and internationally recognized 
research leadership across six broad intersecting areas:
• Advancing Fundamental, Discovery and Theoretical 
Research and Scholarship 
• Illuminating Cultures and Cultivating Creativity 
• Building Healthy Lives, Communities and Reimagining 
Futures 
• Reaching New Horizons in Science, Technology and Society 
• Pursuing Justice, Equity and Sustainability: From Urban 
Dynamics to Global Challenges
• Elevating Entrepreneurship Through Socially Responsible 
Innovation 
Each area includes a broad segment of scholarship and is built 
upon a number of research strengths, where York maintains 
research excellence and forms the basis for York’s recognition 
as a leading Canadian research institution. York is committed 
to ongoing investment that will support these research 
areas across the institution, which, in turn, will enhance the 
influence and recognition of our scholarship and creative 
activity more broadly. In highlighting these key research 
themes, we continue to strategically support our traditional 
research strengths and advance our research vision. 
ADVANCING FUNDAMENTAL, DISCOVERY 
AND THEORETICAL RESEARCH AND 
SCHOLARSHIP
A primary function of universities is to train critical minds, 
to inspire new generations and to encourage questioning of 
the fundamental values and assumptions of our world. The 
promotion of critical scholarship that challenges common 
assumptions and questions mainstream values facilitates 
understanding of the world as we see it. Research at York 
begins with appreciating the importance of fundamental 
inquiry, theoretical research and creative scholarship to 
advance social, scientific and technological developments 
for solving complex societal problems. Throughout the 
University, scholars are investigating the world that surrounds 
us: from the investigation of cells to discovering the cosmos; 
from the study of moral, political and legal philosophy to 
pure mathematics; from the investigation of molecular and 
subatomic interactions to exploring the human brain; from the 
poetic representations of data and generative systems in light 
and sound to the novel use of artificial agents in interactive 
environments; from the study of Indigenous life, cultures 
and traditions to the critical examination of the origins and 
reproduction of the nation-state, political institutions and non-state systems of governance; from the separation of 
neuroscience and computational vision, to their integration to 
yield novel insights into how we perceive and interact with the 
world around us. 
While York values the benefits of applied research and 
development, we recognize that fundamental scholarship, 
systematic examination, and the development of creative 
works and scholarly activities remain essential to the 
advancement of knowledge that moves from discovery to 
invention and back again, requiring a model that transcends 
disciplinary boundaries and facilitates collaboration. At York, 
the advancement of fundamental discovery research and 
theoretical research is sought through the formulation and 
exploration of critical questions that push the boundaries of 
traditional modes of inquiry and scholarship. In the social 
sciences and humanities, a critical approach embraces 
reflective assessments of society, cultural change and ways 
of knowing. To advance critical social and cultural theory, 
researchers are exploring historical change; political activism; 
the social and economic transformations of societies within 
Canada and around the world; and how culture has been and 
continues to be a crucial means of expression and an avenue 
for creative problem solving. Other forms of fundamental 
research in social sciences range from engaging in the study 
of work, employment and labour in the context of a constantly 
changing global economy; deepening our understanding of 
urbanization processes and the city lives and landscapes 
that are created; enhancing knowledge of issues related 
to a variety of transnational phenomena that are rapidly 
changing society, law and governance; and emphasizing 
community-engaged scholarship, real-world and needs-driven 
research, and evidence-based training for effective emergency 
management. 
Critical scholarship at York is a hallmark of the institution and 
is apparent in the research conducted in the natural sciences, 
engineering, arts, humanities and social sciences. Across 
disciplines, the profound dedication to equity is reflected in 
research devoted to understanding and transforming attitudes 
towards constructs of race, class, identity, gender and power 
differentials in a range of social, political, educational, 
ecological and economic formations. Through a critical lens, 
researchers at York are exploring the effects of the global 
movement of people, by displacement or through growing 
diasporas and the rapidly changing urban regions of which 
the University is an integral part. Researchers are exploring 
language acquisition and theories of linguistic variation, and 
educational models that help us understand more clearly 
the role of language in multicultural societies. By pushing the 
boundaries of innovative form and expression in the visual and 
performing arts, researchers probe cultural attitudes towards

languages and knowledges as vital sources of insights for our 
world and for future generations are an essential aspect of this 
research.
York displays strong research leadership in discovery-based 
science across physics, chemistry, pure mathematics, biology, 
psychology and other disciplines. Astrophysics researchers 
use observations and theory to study the origin and evolution 
of structure in the universe, including the role that dark 
matter plays and how galaxies take shape. Using lasers to 
trap and hold individual atoms, quantum optics researchers 
are measuring atomic energy states with unprecedented 
precision, so that even the reliability of fundamental 
constants can be tested. York’s high-energy physicists are 
bringing leadership to large-scale international initiatives 
through TRIUMF (Canada’s National Laboratory for Particle 
and Nuclear Physics), the ATLAS collaboration at CERN (the 
European Organization for Nuclear Research), the Deep 
Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), the Main Injector 
Neutrino ExpeRiment to study v-A interactions (MINERvA), 
and the T2K collaboration in Japan that is seeking out and 
studying the elementary particles of which everything is 
comprised, including neutrinos, antimatter, the Higgs boson 
and magnetic monopoles. Fundamental research in physics, 
mathematics and other natural sciences at York has formed 
the basis of future technologies and toolsets that results in 
solutions for real-world problems. For example, innovative and 
critical advances in pure mathematical concepts in analysis, 
probability, and image and signal processing continue to yield 
novel health, finance and AI applications and technologies. 
Biological research at York extends from molecules to cells, 
organisms, populations and ecosystems. York researchers are 
pushing the boundaries of genomics and proteomics to more 
fully understand how the expression of genes is regulated and 
to determine the structure and function of proteins and other 
macromolecules encoded by the genome. Other fundamental 
bioinformatics research ranges from investigating how growth 
factors, hormones and microRNAs regulate oocyte maturation 
and placental development and how their dysregulation 
contributes to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, to 
developing novel techniques to extract mammal DNA 
from the air that we breathe. Our academics working as 
a part of York’s Centre for Vision Research focus on the 
intersection of biological and computational vision, and work 
in close collaboration to yield an integrated understanding 
of visual perception that spans from basic mathematical 
and computational principles to how these principles are 
implemented in biological mechanisms. These fundamental 
investigations support novel applications ranging from visual 
aids for people with disabilities to new generation autonomous 
robots for navigating unknown terrains. Physiological, metabolic, behavioural, biochemical and 
genetic processes are being investigated in different model 
systems, including yeast, filamentous fungi, insects, fish, 
bees and mice. Researchers in chemistry and biology are 
elucidating the structure of molecules and proteins by nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and 
mass spectrometry, and are making original contributions 
to chemical biology and organic, inorganic and physical 
chemistry, while others are exploring the fundamentals 
of animal behaviour and cognition, including migration 
patterns and how animals adapt to and interact with their 
environments. Other critical research activities in natural 
sciences include studying brain function, mapping and wiring, 
predicting the effects of environmental stressors, such as 
climate change, invasive species and habitat alteration on 
ecosystems, and studying the genetics and evolution of social 
insects to guide the conservation of native pollinators to 
improve their health.

performance practices, including Indigenous narratives 
and storytelling. The focus of research collaboration with Indigenous communities centers on decolonizing education, 
strengthening community and cultural reclamation, and 
exploring Indigenous methodologies through visual 
storytelling. Digital storytelling is also helping to advance 
the understanding of Indigenous student achievement and 
the processes of decolonizing and indigenizing schools. 
For example, linguistics scholars have been assisting in 
the development of language policy as it affects public 
education in Nunavut, and they are providing insight into 
how language policy has led to the threats experienced by 
francophone cultures in Ontario and Quebec. In anthropology, 
researchers critically explore how people are subjected to, 
participate in and contest the processes of living in a world 
that is interconnected by powerful economic, cultural and 
technological forces. Historical scholars examine the forces 
and thinking that have shaped cultures in the past as a 
starting point for acting and thinking in the present, while the 
politics of contemporary, popular and more traditional forms 
of cultural expression are examined from a current political 
science, sociological and communications perspective. 
In theatre, York researchers have traced the genealogical 
development of performance studies in Canada and are 
providing leadership in major international research projects 
from Bali to South Africa.
Researchers are exploring art, digital media and globalization 
to better understand how artists in different cities contribute 
to the development of new cultural and informational 
landscapes. Scholars in this area are documenting new 
cultural formations and community-based cultures – from 
urban parks to transitory performances in neighbourhoods 
and virtual spaces on the internet. Design researchers imagine 
new intelligent user interfaces for the future that inform our 
understanding of communications technology in the world 
today. Practice-based research in dance is focusing on dance 
science, including the psychological aspects of injury as 
well as prevention research, and motor learning and motor 
control, while other types of scholarship is focusing on dance 
history and criticism. York’s music scholars are engaging in

transnational health threats and social inequalities. In 
addition, York supports six health-specific Organized Research 
Units (ORUs) that seek to both inform and transform policy, 
planning and practice such as York University’s Centre for 
Aging Research and Education, drawing on lessons from 
the pandemic to address gaps in long-term residential care, 
transitioning patients from hospital to home or redefining what 
it means to age well in urban centres. 
A sampling of York’s integrative health research extends 
from the laboratory to the community, from cells to society. 
For example, researchers working in the Centre for Vision 
Research (CVR) are advancing understanding of how the 
human brain works and contributing to improved rehabilitation 
for stroke patients and patients with head injuries and new 
treatments for vision loss. As well, our researchers are offering new routes of investigation and insight into the genetic, 
molecular and cellular neurobiology and environmental 
effects on brain development in children with autism. 
Interdisciplinary teams within the Muscle Health Research 
Centre (MHRC) are generating new insights and elucidating 
interactions between health, nutrition and disease, including 
relationships between diabetes, stress and physical activity, 
optimizing mitochondrial health and developing strategies to 
manage hypoglycemia and muscle wasting. In the biomedical 
sciences, research ranges from bioengineering that is 
improving medical device technology (improving diagnosis 
and screening), to interdisciplinary approaches designed to 
improve understanding and treatment of severely debilitating 
and chronic conditions, including a broad range of neurological 
health disorders, concussion, dementia and more within York’s 
Centre for Integrative and Applied Neuroscience (CIAN). Two 
other examples from within the wide spectrum of health-

management and leadership in the burgeoning health industry. 
Additionally, York researchers are advancing discoveries in 
cancer research, such as identifying cancer biomarkers and 
developing new therapies to enhance the quality of life for 
patients with cancer and their families. 
Our researchers are working to address discrimination by 
monitoring the human rights of persons with disabilities 
worldwide, along with health-related inequalities for all 
people, including those who face increased health risks. 
Others are focusing on enhancing literacy and educational 
involvement and well-being among marginalized populations, 
including Indigenous peoples, women, rural populations, 
persons with disabilities, economically disadvantaged 
groups, immigrants, and ethnic and cultural minorities. Child 
and youth research produces leading scholarship on youth 
homelessness, mental health, education and relationships and 
development of infants, children, youth and diverse families. 
Others are looking to break down Western paradigms of health 
care and remove systematic barriers for Indigenous and other 
communities. With a focus on promoting wellness, healthy 
aging and improving quality of life, health scientists with 
the MHRC are exploring critical questions involving muscle 
health and its metabolism, and engineers are designing 
technologies for the aging population, improving mobility and 
quality of life. Other areas of health-related research include 
the influences of air and water quality on human health; the 
association of sustainable growth on individual and population 
health; the use of biomolecular interactions to diagnose and 
treat diseases; and women’s health, sexuality, including the 
intersection of LGBTQ2S sexuality, gender, and human rights.
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 12Capacity-building partnerships that bring together clinicians, 
patients and researchers in a collaborative way are integral 
to York’s health-focused research. For example, we are 
partnering to advance digital health solutions, health 
informatics, integrated electronic health records, as well 
as providing health solutions to inform policy and improve 
outcomes for patients while influence clinical decision making. 
Building on these areas, York is developing new programming 
in health intelligence, health informatics and a new data 
science program to provide our students with the skills they 
need to succeed in navigating the future of health care. Other 
partnerships include working with neighbouring full-service 
hospitals and community-based health care service networks 
to enhance training, research and innovation, and exploring 
ways to improve safety in the health care system through 
enhancing patient-centred care. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on all 
facets of our health and health care systems, rendering visible 
the structural barriers to health inequity. York researchers 
continue to be active in examining many of the different angles 
and impacts of the pandemic – as a transnational health 
threat underscoring the interconnected nature of health, from 
disease modelling and migration to substantial impacts on our 
mental and physical health. Neuroscientists and psychologists 
are studying how wearing protective masks may affect our 
ability to recognize faces and scientists are informing public 
behaviour on effective mask choice and personal protective 
equipment in guarding against infections. York researchers 
continue to study the underlying social determinants of 
health that drive inequality and accelerate illness and disease 
transmission across the world. They are examining and 
providing a broader understanding of intersecting issues, 
including global health governance, social engagement 
and social justice in overcoming health inequities within 
countries and between the Global North and Global South. 
Our researchers are utilizing AI and data science models in 
helping to predict viral transmission and assisting local health 
authorities in mitigating new infections in the developing 
world. Studies are looking at outcomes of the pandemic 
response and recovery phase linking pandemic stigma to 
negative psychological, economic and health outcomes for 
certain diaspora communities in globalized urban centres. As 
well, research is enabling advocacy for mental health support 
for frontline workers, informing policy to help mitigate gender-
based violence associated with the pandemic, and supporting 
differentially affected racialized populations and communities. 
Our researchers are providing a critical voice in the debate 
over health care reform in Canada. They are addressing 
privatization, healthy aging, the erosion of universal health 
care, worker shortages and inequities in health care. The 
recent pandemic has intensified this debate and floodlit 
these challenges. Conducting wide-ranging investigations on 
systemic issues like racial bias in the health care system is 
key to gaining a better understanding of the diverse Canadian population and helping to inform decision makers on creating 
a more responsive and compassionate system. This includes 
a focus on how institutions shape the experiences of people 
who use them. Additional research on larger age equity issues, 
a systematic analysis of the increasing levels of privatization 
within our long-term care system, and promoting improved 
policies and practices that affect conditions and wages for 
care workers are three areas contributing to positive change 
through important and impactful research.

are forging new Indigenous understandings of the natural 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 14world and of reconciliation in a world still largely dominated 
by settler institutions. Through socially engaged projects and 
partnerships, our researchers are asking critical questions 
that probe the nature and possibilities for justice, equity and 
sustainability in local and global contexts. This has allowed 
York researchers to make great contributions to UN SDGs such 
as SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities 
and Communities) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong 
Institutions). The creation of the new Faculty of Environmental 
and Urban Change has signaled the centrality of these 
concerns in York’s research profile.
The nature and scale of existing societal and environmental 
challenges require a broad spectrum of research approaches 
that result in positive change. York researchers are pursuing 
collaborative, integrative and solution-oriented research 
on environmental issues at multiple campuses in various 
countries and through international research partnerships that 
traverse borders and span social sciences, humanities, arts, 
natural sciences, law, business and engineering. For example, 
York has initiated global research collaborations to search 
for ways to challenge the inequities that produce uneven 
anti-microbial resistance across the world. We create original 
scholarship that squarely addresses the relationships between 
urban food insecurity, poverty and housing crises and translate 
research findings into change-oriented and accountable public 
policy. In addition to cutting-edge sustainability initiatives 
on York’s Keele and Glendon campuses, our EcoCampus at 
the Las Nubes Biological Reserve in Costa Rica provides an 
important link to the surrounding communities and acts as a 
living laboratory where issues of neo-tropical conservation, 
education and eco-health are explored. 
York researchers are studying water quality in Canadian 
aquatic environments and investigating threats to these 
habitats. They are examining the health impact of climate 
on vector-borne and waterborne diseases; analyzing water 
degradation due to plastics in lakes and other water sources; 
predicting climate change patterns using insect sub-fossils; 
studying the migratory patterns and health of forest songbirds; 
and studying invasive insects within ecosystems under threat. 
York is a research leader in the biodiversity and conservation 
of bee populations that are vital to the pollination of wild 
plants and crops, which in turn produce food for human 
consumption. Ecologists and environmental scientists study 
the effects of multiple environmental stressors on different 
ecosystems and develop computer models to predict these 
effects. This research advances our understanding of how 
climate change, urban development, contaminants and 
invasive species threaten the North American landscape and 
the biodiversity that is essential to human existence.
York researchers lead tool and process development to 
advance the measurement of Ecological Footprint and 
Biocapacity, to help reduce Canada’s overall carbon footprint, 
and build sustainable energy sources of the future. This includes implementing York’s Energy Management Plan to 
accelerate greenhouse gas emission reductions from the 
University’s central utilities and deep retrofits to buildings, 
and the development of power and renewable energy systems 
and materials for green infrastructure, such as micro- and 
nano-structure bio-materials. Critical research is being 
conducted in engineering that is focused on various waste to 
energy initiatives, for example, reducing carbon emissions 
by extracting energy and other resources from wastewater, 
developing low carbon building materials, and developing 
novel engineering tools to better plan and operate energy 
and transport systems, including researching other promising 
advancements like hydrogen fuel. 
As an urban university with internationally recognized 
expertise in urban design, planning, housing and sustainable 
transportation to facilitate and integrate city life, York

in urban settings. By bridging social and environmental 
research and public policy, York leads the world in research on 
suburban development globally as an approach to examining 
governance, land use, migration, infrastructure and daily life. 
York researchers are focusing on urban immigration gateways, 
like Toronto, looking to enhance the social, economic and 
political inclusion of newcomers to Canadian cities, and they 
are investigating gendered urban insecurities in the urban 
Global South. 
Scholars at York are also investigating the ethical implications 
of climate change, including the responsibilities we have for 
future generations. Issues of cultural citizenship, community 
and the environment are being explored by researchers 
through a range of experimental and creative practices that 
emphasize public art installations and scholarly publications 
that examine urban development, Inuit culture and climate 
change. York researchers are also exploring climatic and 
environmental change in Europe, the Americas, Africa and 
Asia across various historical periods and showing how 
these shifts have had profound social, economic and political 
effects over time. As Canada continues to strive to reach its 
goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, York researchers have 
engaged in research that addresses the justice dimensions 
of the transition to a greener economy, contestation over 
extraction, new energy systems and the distribution of 
pollution burdens affecting marginalized communities and 
vulnerable populations, including through the development 
of ecological footprint indicators. Moreover, as advances in 
information technologies have fostered a digital world that 
involves all aspects of the society, our researchers are delving 
into promoting justice and sustainability of the digital world by 
addressing challenges shaping human activity and changing 
the way we live. The emerging data economy presents unique 
challenges and opportunities, including difficulties in data 
valuation, a conflict between the public good and private gain, 
and an ever-increasing potential for biased data analytics. 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 15Legal scholarship probes important environmental, equity and 
human rights issues in Canadian and global environmental 
law, including those related to Indigenous peoples and the 
environment. This work is complemented by research on 
natural resources law; the impact of resource development 
on constitutionally protected Indigenous rights and treaty 
rights; ethical investment; governance for sustainability; and 
sustainable finance. The theoretical and practical implications 
of law’s role in a just, equitable and sustainable society 
underscore all this work. York researchers are established 
international leaders in research on equity and intersectional 
relations of inequality and oppression. These include anti-
poverty analysis in Canada and in the Global South; politics 
and processes of racialization; workers’ rights and labour 
organizing; inclusive approaches to gender and sexuality; 
as well as critiques of ableism and its resulting inequalities. 
Feminist research at York examines national and transnational 
issues, applying analyses of race, gender, sexuality and other 
axes of difference to labour markets, individual workplaces, 
transitional justice, colonial violence and much more.
Our researchers also examine global migration as a barometer 
of inequality and violent conflict. York researchers focus 
on the violation of fundamental human rights, such as the 
loss of security and livelihoods abroad and the search for 
temporary work in Canada to feed their families back home. 
Researchers of forced migration probe the adjudication of 
refugee claims of those who claim asylum in Canada, including 
the discrepancies in our refugee determination system. York 
is a world leader in migration research on all fronts, but with 
a particular focus on those in precarious circumstances. 
Refugee-related research in international forums and in 
immigration policy thrives at York where strong ties to 
research centres and international organizations abroad have 
been forged over decades of collaboration. York researchers 
address the violence, conflict and impacts of war in all their 
forms. These include addressing transnational criminal 
relations and human rights violations, and their affect on 
migration and the security of refugees, who are the remnants 
of global geopolitics amid war and humanitarian emergency. 
ELEVATING ENTREPRENEURSHIP THROUGH 
SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION
York fosters a thriving community of scholars who are 
passionately interested in how socially responsible 
innovation can improve our economy and our planet. With 
the increasingly entrepreneurial nature of the University, York 
continues to create breakthrough innovations by aligning its 
research with societal and market needs. Entrepreneurship 
research at York is conducted within a broader community 
setting that emphasizes social justice. Our exploration of 
factors that contribute to the technological developments, 
market innovations and the performance of entrepreneurial 
ventures is balanced by research that critically questions the assumptions underpinning market capitalism, neoliberal 
political models, Eurocentrism and bourgeois culture. Along 
with leading scholars in social and market-based innovation, 
entrepreneurship and business management, York boasts 
several of the world’s leading critics of contemporary capitalist 
society who are exploring the violence of capitalist, colonial 
and patriarchal states, societies and economic systems, and 
the nature of the structures of governance that instantiate and 
sustain these inhumane inequities from the local to the global 
stage. Rather than being incompatible, these two research 
areas generate a productive tension that, in turn, yields a 
unique perspective on the development and implementation 
of responsible innovation. 
Entrepreneurship has clear ties to economic performance, 
yet entrepreneurial innovation is far from being restricted 
to goals driven only by the profit motive. Entrepreneurs 
increasingly seek ethical pathways to develop and conduct 
business in a manner that contributes to the well-being 
of society. Responsible innovation requires governing 
technological, scientific and economic development in a 
conscientious manner. York researchers strive to illuminate 
the conditions that can foster such responsible innovation: 
many are recognized as world leaders in research regarding 
sustainability, corporate social responsibility, business 
ethics, social enterprise and social sector management. 
The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a range of other global 
developments, has given new urgency to extending our 
understanding of how business can be conducted responsibly 
given the complexities of contemporary social and economic 
conditions. For instance, through our globally recognized 
Centre of Excellence in Responsible Business (COERB), York 
researchers are creating and disseminating new knowledge 
about the social, environmental, ethical and political 
responsibilities of business.
As attention to environmental, social and corporate 
governance (ESG) issues has become a critical priority for 
organizations, researchers at York are well positioned to 
advance knowledge regarding rapidly evolving ESG challenges 
and practices. This research is focused on creating new 
knowledge about the social, ethical, environmental and 
political responsibilities of organizations, and how critical 
issues facing organizations can be addressed. Scholars from 
across the humanities, social sciences, law and business 
are engaged in tackling critical, interconnected issues in this 
regard, such as examining how ESG factors and climate risks 
intersect with relevant policies and laws in Canada, including 
the impact on Indigenous communities and the duty to 
consult. 
This same ethos informs our research into extractive industry 
practices, the adoption of new technologies (including AI), 
international intellectual property regulation, and trade and 
investment agreements. Still other initiatives examine labour 
standards and relations, and probe how public policy can 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028  | York University — 16promote socio-economic equality for workers both in Canada 
and abroad. The Global Labour Research Centre (GLRC) at 
York engages in the study of work, employment and labour
in the context of a constantly changing global economy. 
Research into venture capital, finance, private equity, real  
estate and infrastructure occurs alongside research into the 
cultural, social and economic challenges of human migration, 
settlement and diasporas. At the Lassonde School of 
Engineering, there is an emphasis on engineering that brings
a sense of the public interest and corporate responsibility
to professional practice, which is reflected in the creation
of research programs exploring transportation networks, 
energy solutions and the development of new devices and 
technologies.
Through Innovation York, the University has launched several 
initiatives that include York University’s pan-institution 
entrepreneurship hub with over 16 different programs,
building a unique entrepreneurial community.  All these 
programs are delivered through YSpace: ELLA, Ontario’s
first accelerator focused on women-led businesses;
YSpace Digital, offering a variety of online supports
and services; YSpace Markham, a physical incubator
supporting growth-ready ventures; and YSpace Georgina,
with entrepreneurial resources and collaboration space
located in the Northern York Region. York also partnered
with the Black Creek Community Health Centre to create
the Black Entrepreneurship Alliance, focused on creating 
entrepreneurial support and upskilling opportunities. Our 
entrepreneurial programming is establishing York as both
a recognized leader and an entrepreneurial hub, delivering 
unique programs that are first of a kind in the industry.  York  
now operates Ontario’s first food and beverage accelerator
and Ontario’s first women-led professional services ventures,  
as well as Northern Ontario’s first entrepreneurial hub.  These  
initiatives have worked towards maximizing the commercial, 
economic and social impacts of research and innovation; from 
helping to reduce the gender equality gap in entrepreneurship 
to creating opportunities for all entrepreneurs, these initiatives 
are exemplars of socially responsible innovation at York.
A common thread through all of York’s initiatives is our 
collaborative approach to knowledge creation and social
and commercial innovation, according to which academic 
researchers work with community partners, the private
sector and policy makers to advance and promote social 
consciousness and enhance business and economic practices. 
York researchers exhibit leadership that fosters innovation
and enhances society’s capacity for building sustainable 
livelihoods while supporting the public good and contributing 
to our regional economy. Founded by York, Research Impact 
Canada, a pan-Canadian network of 23 institutions, hospitals 
and research organizations, is a national leader in the
practice of creating social value and impact from research, 
knowledge and innovation. These initiatives have greatlycontributed to UN SDGs, including SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation 
and Infrastructure) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption 
and Production).
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 17RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES: COMPELLING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE 
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH
Within the breadth and diversity of cutting-edge scholarship at 
York, there are many areas where scholars have coalesced to 
provide enhanced opportunities for leadership and recognition 
through strategic investment in more focused collaborative 
activities. These are complemented by emerging areas of 
research that are underpinned by a strong vision of the York 
community achieving new levels of research leadership in 
ways that bring a unique York perspective to solving some of 
the world’s most compelling challenges. Some opportunities 
are driven by new frontiers of fundamental inquiry, while 
others reflect the convergence of strong academic interest 
and external opportunities that can have a transformational 
effect on society. All of which reflect the ability of York to make 
unique contributions.
Development of these opportunities brings together varied 
perspectives, disciplines and understandings to deliver 
innovative achievements and address emerging challenges. 
Strategically, by committing to supporting and building these 
areas of opportunity, we are positioning ourselves to further 
enhance the profile and deepen the recognition of York’s 
ground-breaking scholarship that informs our academic 
programming. Some opportunities were initiated in our 
2018-2023 SRP and have the potential to further enhance 
the University’s profile. Other new opportunities reflect the 
progress of our scholarship and the evolving world around us 
in areas where York researchers have the potential to excel:
• Digital Cultures and Disruptive Technologies 
• Healthy Communities, Equity and Global Well-being 
• Indigenous Futurities
• Climate Action for a Sustainable Planet
• Social Justice, Peace and Equitable Relations
• Inter and Transdisciplinary Research Innovation 
DIGITAL CULTURES AND DISRUPTIVE 
TECHNOLOGIES 
The digital revolution that we are currently witnessing has 
been referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as this 
new stage of human development has been enabled by 
extraordinary technological advances comparable with and, 
in some cases, even exceeding those of the first, second 
and third industrial revolutions. This era of embedded 
connectivity is distinguished by the widespread, rapid and 
common use of technology throughout society; these rapid 
technological advances continue to merge the physical, digital 
and biological worlds in a manner that creates both promising 
opportunities and potential risks. With the continued upsurge of social media platforms, the expansion of complex 
algorithms, and the growth of data sets, the scope and level 
of activity of this digital revolution continues to accelerate 
while its implications are still being fully understood. Digital 
technologies have given rise to vast new industries; enabled 
the development of various forms of AI and machine learning; 
and transformed means of communication, ways of learning 
and cultural industries – thereby disrupting notions of culture, 
society, knowledge and citizenship in highly significant ways. 
Consequently, there is a continued need for research on 
the digital world at the intersection of the arts, sciences, 
computing, law and engineering, pushing technological 
boundaries while critically investigating the social, cultural and 
legal impacts and the ways in which it is shaping and changing 
human activity and interaction. 
AI-related research at York has gained considerable 
momentum over the past five years, with research ranging 
from the development of novel computer vision systems in 
science and technology for deployment on handheld and 
robotic devices as well as other intelligent agents, to new 
brain-inspired AI systems, through application to smart cities, 
data analytics, disaster management, emergency planning and 
disease transmission models, to novel legal and governance 
frameworks.  Currently, more than 140 faculty members are 
engaged in AI-related and digital cultures research at York, 
contributing to both technological applications of research 
as well as an interconnected transdisciplinary approach. 
York’s program offerings are reflective of this with both 
undergraduate and graduate programs in digital cultures, 
digital media and related areas, which are being offered jointly 
by the Lassonde School of Engineering and School of the Arts, 
Performance, Media and Design. Likewise, Health Studies 
offers programming on health informatics, eHealth, health 
policy and health management, and the School of Information 
Technology offers programs on non-standard applications 
of AI, such as fintech (cryptocurrency, algo-trading), 
cybersecurity and technological sustainability.
York researchers are also working to advance the development 
and implementation of digital technologies to ensure their 
equitable and ethical adoption, as well as exploring how the 
increasingly digital world influences the way we live, interact 
and conduct business. For example, our researchers are 
exploring AI and digital technologies within the digital media 
contexts and legal frameworks through IP Osgoode (Osgoode 
Hall Law School’s Intellectual Property Law and Technology 
Program) and the IP Innovation Clinic (innovation-to-society 
intellectual property legal clinic). Other scholars from across 
the humanities, social sciences, health, engineering and 
law are addressing the potential risks of emerging 
disruptive technologies, including AI, and their effects on 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 18governments, public policy, labour markets, sovereignty, 
personal and national security, human health and health 
systems, as well as the challenges they pose to our sense 
of individual identity, collective humanity, equity and human 
rights.  Work in this area also explores research creation in 
immersive environments such as virtual and augmented 
reality; the impact of digital usage in a variety of community 
settings, including Indigenous communities; how digitally 
based forms of knowledge and expertise are emerging online; 
and how digital gaming can inform education. Importantly, 
this holistic approach is characterized by a deep engagement 
with community, industry partners, public agencies and 
international organizations focusing on the impacts and 
applications of digital technologies. This work is aided by the 
rich offerings and supports of the Digital Scholarship Centre 
and the Media Creation Lab provided by the York University 
Libraries, which provide a gateway to equitable access to 
those researchers who want to engage with digital cultures 
and disruptive technologies. Further, coordinating investment 
and promoting interdisciplinary interactions will propel 
research and strengthen industry-academic collaboration 
in these areas. We will continue building our cutting-edge 
digital arts and technology research and continue our existing 
collaborations with some of Canada’s most prominent digital 
media hardware and software companies. 
As technological advances foster new systems, impacting 
many dimensions of society, we have identified the integration 
of disruptive technologies into society as a critical area for 
accelerated research over the next five years.  One critical 
opportunity will be guiding the ethical, legal, sociological and 
technical development of the rapidly expanding technology, 
including AI, high-performance computing that is associated 
with the challenges of big data, as well as technological 
literacy that all societies face today.  Beyond AI, we will 
extend our leadership in new disruptive technologies 
(including health informatics, Beyond 5G, advanced VR, nano, 
cybersecurity, and smart cities) as well as their applications 
in social sciences, humanities, health and other STEM fields; 
interfaces and content creation, scientific inquiry, design, 
policy development and critical discourse in digital media. 
We will further our recognized leadership at the interface of 
an expanding cluster of creative industries in film, television, 
informatics, data visualization games and app development. 
Moving forward, York will continue to advance key 
recommendations outlined in our AI task force’s November 
2021 report, titled  Fostering the Future of Artificial Intelligence: 
Report for the York University Task Force on AI & Society , to 
further advance York as a future global centre of excellence 
for AI-related initiatives and research. Support in this area 
will leverage York’s current success in digital media, AI, data 
science and the broader impacts of innovation on society, 
encouraging continued innovation to sustain our leadership.HEALTHY COMMUNITIES, EQUITY AND 
GLOBAL WELL-BEING
As the greatest public health challenge in more than a century, 
the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed our lives, our world, 
our economy and our health care system. The pandemic has 
placed our health care system under enormous stress and 
has worsened long-standing issues, such as lack of access to 
primary care in communities across Canada, health human 
resources planning and staffing constraints, patient backlogs 
and the adoption of new technologies. From addressing 
long-standing issues to reimagining health care systems, the 
issues we face are broad and far-reaching. 
As we continue to tackle COVID-19 and adjust to the many 
socio-economic changes that it has brought, our researchers 
have aimed to better understand the changes that are needed 
in our health care system. The pandemic has had a particularly 
devastating impact on long-term care homes – researchers 
are investigating the conditions of care and the state of the 
health care labour force and especially those working in long-
term care. Health care providers have turned to online tools 
to deliver services remotely during the pandemic, causing a 
rethink of how digital innovation can be used in health care but 
also causing increased inequities for vulnerable communities. 
Consequently, researchers are examining how to adapt 
eHealth for a broader population and strengthen the ability to 
detect and respond to public health events and emergencies. 
Moreover, given the emerging challenges from the pandemic, 
health care management is in a state of flux with growing 
demand, less access and challenges to delivery. There is a 
need to optimize access to the right care, promptly, and in 
the right place, geographically. As such, York researchers are 
working to improve efficiencies around patient wait times 
and health care staffing shortages using advanced AI tools. 
Meanwhile, researchers in the humanities and social sciences 
are examining the structural- and system-level barriers and 
drivers of access to health care.
Aging and increasingly diverse populations, together with the 
growing complexity and personalization of health care, are 
driving the search for health care solutions that emphasize 
wellness and disease prevention to minimize the need for 
medical intervention. Increasingly, medical advances are 
transforming acute conditions such as neurodegenerative 
diseases, HIV infection and cancer into long-term chronic 
conditions that must be treated and monitored over decades. 
In alignment with the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021-
2030), to provide long-term, sufficient levels of care, smart 
regulations and innovative solutions to improve quality and 
outcomes is closely linked with the strengths of York’s health 
research, which focuses on accountability in the public system 
and community health and wellness, emphasizing York’s 
commitments to equity and social justice.
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 19In the developing world, health inequities and challenges 
affect far greater percentages of people. In addition to learning 
how to export and translate health care solutions globally to 
respond to challenges, there is a pressing need to extend the 
partnership with developing nations to empower global health 
care solutions and break down historically vertical models for 
their transmission and adoption. York researchers are crossing 
disciplines where studies of health intersect with the social 
sciences, health sciences and natural sciences, along with 
assistance from engineering and computer science to address 
problems that have interconnected global implications 
affecting health of populations, while always being mindful of 
underlying cultural, social, legal, environmental and economic 
perspectives.
Health research has gained considerable momentum and 
recognition over the past five years through the individual 
achievements of researchers and the successful launch of 
major initiatives, as well as collaborations across a wide 
range of disciplines. Examples include the following: Vision 
to Science Applications (VISTA) that bring together the 
visual sciences and their application and societal impacts; 
Connected Minds: Neural & Machine Systems for a Healthy, 
Just Society, which has over 200 researchers working to 
address the rapidly emerging “techno-social” collective 
and examining the benefits and risks to communities; the 
Health Care Ecosphere that is leading the development and 
commercialization of personalized health care solutions and 
health technologies that evolve traditional health prevention 
and management; York University Centre for Aging Research 
and Education that is pursuing responses to changes and 
challenges from aging at a community and individual level; 
and the Dahdelah Institute for Global Health Research, whose 
researchers pursue solutions to global health challenges with 
a focus on governance, policy and management systems to 
fully realize benefits. 
Over the next five years we are committed to expanding 
research that focuses on the social determinants of health, 
health care regulations, digital health, health outcomes and 
the promotion of wellness. From biomolecular engineering to 
the health of populations, from biomedical to social work and 
health law, and from healthy aging in communities to global 
child health rights, researchers will accelerate their individual 
success and will fully realize the potential of recently launched 
initiatives. In addition, we will pursue new partnerships across 
health care, social services, natural sciences, engineering 
and global health sectors to extend the leadership and 
influence of our research. With the opening of a new campus 
in Markham in 2024, we expect to further enhance our 
focus on community engagement, while new directions in 
bioengineering research will be launched with the continuing 
expansion of our engineering programs.

is expected to build on York’s ability to address Ontario’s 
evolving and unmet clinical and community health care needs. 
A key driver in this research is the school of nursing with a 
vibrant socially minded collegium of diverse researchers 
who make as their central goal the health and well-being of 
individuals, families and communities. Over the longer-term, 
York maintains its aspiration for a new kind of medical school 
to focus on integrated interdisciplinary, team-based family 
primary care, community health and wellness through the 
lifespan. Informed by demographics, health care gaps and 
the evolution of medicine, our emphasis is on the integration 
of primary care physicians within the context of the broader 
health care and wellness promotion teams. As a partner in 
the Vaughan Healthcare Centre Precinct (VHCP), York is well 
positioned to advance health care practices and outcomes 
through local and global partnerships.
York is also deeply committed to fostering innovative 
approaches, technologies and perspectives to solve problems 
and promote global economic and social well-being. Building 
off the success of our entrepreneurship hub YSpace, York is 
committed to supporting social innovation and the translation 
of new knowledge to decision and policy makers, as well as 
the commercialization of innovations developed within the 
VHCP through start-up venture creation and growth programs. 
The tremendous wealth offered by the surrounding disciplines 
at the University will provide unique perspectives and 
innovative approaches to solving some of the most pressing 
questions in health promotion and practice, disease and injury 
prevention, and health care delivery.
INDIGENOUS FUTURITIES
Deeply rooted in history, futurities recognizes that the future, 
despite its intangibility, is directly impacting us today.1
Indigenous futurity considers how Indigenous revivals 
might be viewed as expressions of “futurity,” operating in 
resistance to those assumptions that consign Native American 
[Indigenous] peoples and lifeways to the past.2
York University has a long-standing commitment to access, 
inclusion, equity and diversity. In a time when truth, 
reconciliation and justice are dominating public discourse 
about Indigenous issues and when Indigenous communities 
in Canada and around the world are facing severe health, 
social, legal and societal challenges, the need for research 
that imagines the future has never been greater. Learning from 
Indigenous ways of knowing, ways of being, worldviews and 
laws, futurities research will contribute to changing lives and 
will significantly affect nations, communities and individuals. 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 20Indigenous Futurities will help research make a positive 
impact on Indigenous communities, with a strong focus on 
the importance of First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. 
As a recognized global leader in socially engaged research 
and knowledge mobilization, York is committed to building 
community partnerships in research. As a part of “The 
Indigenous Framework” (2017), York pledged to “ facilitate 
research that is relevant to Indigenous life and respects 
Indigenous approaches to knowledge and learning .”3 York’s 
researchers are positioned to collaborate with local and global 
Indigenous communities on research that will contribute to 
improving community life while enhancing cultural, economic 
and environmental sustainability. Never losing sight of 
history, this research opportunity simultaneously insists on 
consideration of our relationships to Indigenous futures and 
the ways they will continue to influence and shift the emphasis 
in current research and innovation. 
York is home to a large group of scholars who include 
faculty, postdoctoral fellows and undergraduate and 
graduate students, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, 
whose research exists in relation to Indigeneity. These 
scholars engage in a range of contexts and topics from the 
epistemological to the environmental, from the mathematical 
to the methodological, exploring interrelations across 
disciplinary boundaries and borders. Recent Indigenous 
research initiatives are focusing on circumpolar cultural 
sovereignty, including collaboration with Inuit, Alaska Native 
and Sami communities; community engagement on mining 
and extraction in Baffin Island, Northwest Territories and 
Yukon Territory; the role of youth in health promotion, and the 
legal and environmental interrogation of just and equitable 
relationships; the interactions between Indigenous and 
non-Indigenous laws; the histories of Métis, First Nations, 
Inuit and Native-American relationships with colonialism; 
Indigenous language policies, art and education; Indigenous 
knowledge systems and their various applications in diverse 
contexts that include water and environmental governance, 
environmental justice, forest policy and management, and 
sustainable development; and urban Indigenous education 
and communities. Most significant, Indigenous researchers 
have made major contributions to the scholarship of 
Indigenous ways of knowing. This opportunity area will further 
support and enhance these existing initiatives and foster 
deeper engagement with these and other developing research 
projects.

years, we remain publicly committed to our ongoing efforts to 
address barriers to Indigenous research,4 and to reach a level 
of research excellence. The following accomplishments have 
been made since 2018: 
• In 2021, York launched the Centre for Indigenous 
Knowledges and Languages (CIKL), an organized 
research unit committed to Indigenous approaches for 
the environment, education, languages and decolonizing 
research. Researchers at CIKL are examining a broad range 
of topics: climate justice issues facing Indigenous peoples, 
proliferating beadwork as a form of knowledge mobilization, 
supporting Indigenous-led conservation, and enhancing the 
protection of water and Indigenous water governance.
• In 2022 (ongoing), York provided additional supports 
to CIKL to fund an associate director and a full-time 
coordinator.
• York developed an action plan to address recommendations 
in the report “Decolonizing Research Administration: An 
Evaluation of Indigenous Research at York University.”5 
This action plan is being implemented jointly by the Vice-
President Research and Innovation and the Vice-President 
Equity, People and Culture in development with the 
Indigenous Council at York.
• In 2023, Senate approved the creation of Canada’s first 
dedicated Indigenous Research Ethics Board involving 
community members and including Elders and youth.
• Starting in 2023, York invested in Indigenous Research 
Seed Grants and has made a commitment to invest for three 
years.
• York created the Indigenous Incentive Grants and 
Indigenous Scholarly Events and Outreach Grants. 
• York hired an Associate Vice-President Indigenous 
Initiatives and has committed to hiring an Indigenous 
Research Support Specialist. 
• York hired Indigenous Provostial Postdoctoral Fellows and 
is accepting applications for additional postdoctoral fellows 
going forward.
• With guidance and input from Indigenous Council and CIKL, 
Knowledge Mobilization (KMb) York developed a tool to 
help non-Indigenous researchers engage with Indigenous 
communities. 
Indigenous-related research consistently references 
community: whether within an urban context, a nation or a 
global community. An Indigenous worldview insists that within 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 21a community all relations matter and having good relations 
with all of Creation is foundational to healthy communities. 
As community-based research, the focus covers a broad 
spectrum of lands and territories and insists on acknowledging 
specificity of context. Notions of relationship-building, 
reciprocity of process and outcome, respectful engagement 
with each other and relevance of the work to those involved 
in the projects are integral to the research. This opportunity 
encompasses post-colonial interests, trans-Indigenous theory, 
and other forward-looking community-referenced, reciprocally 
beneficial research.
Over the next five years, the focus of this research opportunity 
will be on Indigenous Futurities and will include social, 
cultural, artistic, legal, policy, economic and justice areas 
that holistically shape Indigenous experience. Collaboration 
in exploring Indigenous and non-Indigenous approaches in 
these areas, while understanding the need for Indigenous 
researchers to take the lead, will mark the distinctiveness 
of York’s approach. The intent of this opportunity is to 
ensure that Indigenous-related research includes a 
commitment to listening to and learning from Indigenous 
peoples’ knowledges, laws, ecology, spiritual practices and 
experiences. The commitment of researchers to participate 
in imagining the future while never losing sight of the past will 
enhance our commitment to the import and role of research in 
creating the future we desire.
CLIMATE ACTION FOR A SUSTAINABLE 
PLANET
In Canada and around the globe, climate action is no longer 
a matter of political debate or individual conviction – it is 
an existential threat that demands a research and evidence 
base to enact change. As human population and activities 
grow, there are ever-greater pressures on our environment 
and societies from climate change, loss of biodiversity, 
pollution and the proliferation of disease. These challenges 
contribute to increasing inequalities and creating new 
disparity among peoples and countries. The climate crisis 
is urgent; social, economic and infrastructure impacts will 
continue to accelerate if we do not act now. We must pave 
a stronger path towards a more sustainable planet and 
addressing the emergencies and disasters along the way. In 
further elevating York’s contributions to UN SDG 13 (Climate 
Action) over the next five years, York will invest in research 
to concretely address this climate crisis, building on and 
expanding its knowledge and experience related to climate 
change to meet this challenge. We will apply our expertise on 
disaster response and humanitarian emergencies to acute 
weather events caused by global warming here in Canada 
and abroad, paying careful attention to and including those 
historically marginalized from these activities as partners and as beneficiaries. As noted above, York’s new research centre, 
Y-EMERGE, has been created to capture and consolidate this 
world-renowned expertise.
Across disciplines, York scholars are recognized as world 
leaders in research on the root causes, expression and 
consequences of inequality and oppression. The underlying 
factors driving the climate crisis and the manifold 
consequences of key environmental and societal challenges 
are a concentrated focus of research at York. So too are 
sustainability efforts to achieve net-zero emissions on our 
campuses and off. York has developed a new Sustainability 
Framework to ensure sustainability is a critical part of both 
scholarly and social and cultural sphere of York’s campus and 
community. The framework sets out a more synergetic and 
coordinated effort between on-campus sustainability related 
activities, including teaching, research, and practice. These 
goals will be achieved through new technologies for energy, 
transportation, home construction and heating, urban planning 
and regulatory innovation to incentivize a smaller carbon 
footprint. Above all, research in this area strives to inform and 
enhance law and public policies that shape the behaviour of 
governments, public and private organizations, and individuals. 
Growth in individual and collaborative scholarship at York in 
this area over the past five years has been remarkable. York’s 
research partnerships and networks that examine elements 
of the climate crisis extend far beyond the borders of Toronto 
and Canada, into Global South and Global North countries 
and their civil societies. York’s new Faculty of Environmental 
and Urban Change represents an interdisciplinary response 
to the climate crisis, in which researchers spanning the 
sciences, social science, humanities and visual arts are 
addressing understandings, impacts and solutions in relation 
to climate change. 
Any major societal or environmental challenge – whether food 
insecurity, global warming or species demise – does not affect 
everyone or everything equally. For example, humans will 
experience different consequences from non-human animals 
in relation to habitats under threat; and one’s nationality, 
ethnonational identity, class, gender, ability and location within 
historically salient colonialism will shape one’s relationship 
to the climate crisis, with those who have historically been 
negatively affected becoming even more adversely affected. 
Researchers are collaborating on interdisciplinary and broader 
transdisciplinary teams across York but also with partners 
across the world to tackle a range of climate-related issues: 
some use big data to probe the political and social pressures 
on the migration of peoples and the challenges faced by 
refugees; others have built an international network exploring 
and exchanging relevant solutions for youth homelessness 
and child welfare; and still others are examining the evolving 
regimes of precarious work in Canada and through studies of 
employment and labour in the global economy. The design 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 22of cities to be resilient, inclusive and sustainable is a huge 
challenge that York researchers are addressing through 
applied work with community partners and the City of Toronto, 
and across the country with partners addressing gendered 
and racialized challenges of employment, housing, health and 
much more. Social scientists and engineering researchers 
collaborate on sustainability around transportation, meshing 
this analysis with equity in underserved communities, 
renewable energy research, and exploration of business 
ethics, the social economy and corporate social responsibility 
scholarship at York.
Building on this base over the next five years, research in 
this area will inform and address emerging issues in urban, 
rural and wilderness environments on local, national and 
global scales. This research will include the preservation of 
ecosystems, landscapes and species; address the challenges 
of emission and pollution; and maintain a sustained focus 
on human-animal interactions. York’s commitment to UN 
SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) reaffirms our 
research momentum on issues of governance and human 
rights, with implications not only for Indigenous reconciliation, 
global migration and diplomacy but also extractivism, cultural 
genocide and reparations in the wake of violence. Economic 
prosperity and ameliorating poverty remain squarely on York’s 
research agenda, along with related issues of security in all 
its forms. York will continue to lead Global North countries 
with its global network of researchers addressing youth 
homelessness with new projects that engage Indigenous 
partners and issues of homelessness among First Nations. 
York remains committed to developing new knowledge and 
solutions to achieve a just, equitable and sustainable future 
with and for Canadians and with communities across the 
world. To supplement our sustainability research at the Keele 
and Glendon campuses as well as the EcoCampus at the Las 
Nubes Biological Reserve in Costa Rica, research partnerships 
that cross borders and engage communities will be a major 
focus of the University’s new Markham campus. Research at 
this campus will focus on directly engaging the surrounding 
cities, organizations and residents in developing and fostering 
collaborative partnerships with businesses, social services and 
regional schools. We plan to continue investing in our whole-
institution approach to sustainability, embedding sustainable 
principles in every aspect of university life and generating 
knowledge that integrates the social, cultural, economic 
and environmental dimensions of complex sustainability 
challenges at scales ranging from the local to the global. 
SOCIAL JUSTICE, PEACE AND EQUITABLE 
RELATIONS 
York was founded on a mission of social justice. With our 
long-standing commitment to the values of equity, diversity 
and inclusion, we are working together to create an equitable and inclusive scholarly environment that aims to create an 
equitable and inclusive society. This is critical in achieving 
inclusive excellence, where a multiplicity of research, 
perspectives and lived experiences creates positive change 
towards a more innovative, just and sustainable world. 
York’s tradition of scholarship has been defined by a critical 
discourse in which the pursuit of discovery, innovation and 
engagement with broader society is achieved with a focus 
on social responsibility, community engagement, equity and 
justice. These values and core principles are shared by our 
research community and serve to strengthen and underpin our 
research priorities. 
This commitment has set a rich context for the profile of 
inclusionary research and scholarship that forms the core of 
our research enterprise and helps to shape our future direction 
as a dynamic, metropolitan and multicultural university 
open to the world. York conducts wide-ranging research 
examining historical and contemporary dynamics of cultural 
diasporas, promoting an understanding of experiences as 
part of a larger global community, within a network of ORUs 
that contribute to several UN SDGs: SDG 5 (Gender Equality), 
SDG 6 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 10 
(Reduced Inequalities). York boasts a rich assortment of 
inclusionary research among its 31 ORUs, exploring a range 
of racial, moral, religious, political, feminist, Indigenous, 
age-related, environmental and legal philosophies, as 
well as an examination all forms of discrimination and 
promotion of human rights. Research on decolonization and 
reconciliation focuses on reconfiguring settler-Indigenous-
state relationships incorporating Indigenous methods of 
truth-telling and principles of restorative justice. This critical 
inquiry allows us to consider voices otherwise silenced by 
historical or contemporary injustice or marginalization. Further 
research in these areas study our conceptions of diversity and 
the methods needed to explore it, contributing to the shaping 
of identification and identity. For example, recent seminal 
research at York examines the ways in which accessible 
and equitable opportunities in education and employment 
account for the lived experiences of marginalized community 
members. Other researchers are contributing in areas such as 
digital inequality and injustice and addressing social-economic 
and cultural divides produced by differentiated access to 
information technologies. Further research is considering 
the environment and emerging inequalities among specific 
communities, including our understanding and support of 
Indigenous climate leadership and governance, specifically 
through a feminist and gendered lens to help amplify voices of 
Indigenous women and youth. 
This is further borne out in York’s approach to integrating 
large scale transformative and structural changes to the way 
York hires and adjudicates research opportunities. Inspired 
by a need for change, York has created a system that invites 
research excellence from those who are typically overlooked 
and disadvantaged when it comes to research opportunities 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 23in academia. Places of Online Learning for the Adjudication 
of Researchers Inclusively and Supportively (POLARIS) is a 
first-in-Canada online training program to reduce unconscious 
bias and systemic barriers that offers rich and informative 
tools. This system supports both EDI practices and fosters 
better awareness and education among faculty as we seek to 
diversify our research collegium. 
York is also supportive of an equitable and inclusive campus 
environment. In addition to POLARIS, York has been active 
in supporting emerging Black and Indigenous researchers 
as well as addressing structural barriers in research through 
the York Black Research Seed Grants and the Indigenous 
Research Seed Grants. York is working towards a research 
culture that interacts in positive and respectful ways with 
Indigenous people and Indigenous knowledges, as well as 
making room for Indigenous research and Indigenous forms 
of disseminating research. York is implementing an action 
plan to decolonize research and research administration with 
the input and guidance of the Indigenous Council at York, and 
York’s Vice-President Equity, People and Culture. This includes 
the chartering of the Centre for Indigenous Knowledges and 
Languages (CIKL) and providing additional administrative 
supports, and the approval of York’s Indigenous Research 
Ethics Board. These activities will be supported by creating 
the position of an Indigenous Research Support Specialist. In 
addition, the VPRI has provided additional research funding 
for ORUs with an EDI mandate, including the Harriet Tubman 
Institute for Research on Africa and Its Diasporas, the Centre 
for Research on Latin America and the Caribbean (CERLAC), 
and the Centre for Feminist Research (CFR). Furthermore, 
York’s community-informed Decolonization, Equity, Diversity 
and Inclusion Strategy (DEDI) 2022-2027 will help to 
strengthen and coordinate existing efforts at York by providing 
a guiding framework to drive change through localized 
strategies and actions across the institution. 
While fostering inclusionary scholarship, it is vital that we 
support knowledge creation that will have a positive impact 
on the communities we serve and build the profile and 
reputation of all equity-seeking groups. Within the VPRI, the 
Knowledge Mobilization Unit (KMb) and Entrepreneurship 
program have established strong relationships with the Jane 
Finch community organizations, including the TD Community 
Engagement Centre. Further, York’s faculty and librarians 
have long supported the Jane Finch Community Research 
Partnership, a long-standing collaboration that advances 
strong communities and an approach of reciprocity, equity and 
inclusion. Our deep roots in the York Region include a history 
of ongoing collaborations with the United Way Greater Toronto 
that focus on community organizations serving the needs of 
traditionally marginalized communities. One example is the 
community-campus knowledge mobilization collaboration 
with the Community Music School of Toronto (formerly the Regent Park School of Music), which has flourished into a 
donor-funded Research Chair in Community Based Music with 
funding dedicated to ongoing and emerging collaborations. 
In building on our commitments to decolonization, equity, 
diversity, inclusion and societal justice, we will continue 
to enhance and support our research efforts over the next 
five years, informing critical discussions of the sources 
and nature of inequalities and oppressions; in turn, these 
initiatives will better inform actions that can change and 
transform these inequalities. The University will continue to 
ensure that appropriate sensitivity to cultural and community 
rights, roles and responsibilities are applied to all research 
projects conducted at York. We will further cultivate inclusive 
and equitable research environments that nurture multiple 
and intersectional ways of scholarship and knowing. York 
remains committed to foregrounding the voice and needs 
of Indigenous communities within Indigenous research, 
facilitating research that is relevant to Indigenous life and 
respects Indigenous approaches to knowledge and learning, 
as well as the study of Indigenous knowledge systems and 
their various applications in diverse contexts, including water 
and environmental governance, environmental justice, forest 
policy and management, and sustainable development. 
Likewise, York is dedicated to expanding collaborative 
research and programming that is relevant to the historical, 
cultural and creative productions of Black and other racialized 
communities. There are centuries of accumulated traditional 
knowledges that we believe are fundamental to solving some 
of the complex problems we face as a society.
INTER- AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY 
RESEARCH INNOVATION
As the world continues to address urgent global challenges 
such as climate change, global health crises and political 
polarization and their impact on people and the planet, 
it is critical now more than ever for York to support novel 
transdisciplinary research approaches that help drive 
innovative solutions to these multifaceted problems. Solving 
these increasingly complex societal challenges will require 
a more holistic model, one that integrates knowledge 
between different disciplines, across disciplines and beyond 
each single discipline, involving various stakeholders and 
understanding issues through a social, economic, political 
and environmental lens. Through engagement between the 
different participants, new understandings are co-produced 
to generate solutions to the increasingly dynamic problems 
that far exceed the boundaries of contemporary academic 
disciplines and stakeholders. This transdisciplinary approach 
integrates different views and methods from a range of related 
disciplines into a common conceptual framework and provides 
a more inclusive perspective to understanding the causes and 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 24consequences of an issue. This transdisciplinary framework 
extends to delivering socially relevant solutions that are 
responsive, relevant and socially applicable.   
York’s excellence in interdisciplinary research is renowned.  
But increasingly, York researchers are moving towards a 
transdisciplinary approach as dynamic research questions 
continue to evolve.  York researchers are cultivating 
this thinking across disciplines through our Catalyzing 
Interdisciplinary Research Clusters program fund, which aims 
to foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration, 
global research excellence and world-class training 
opportunities.  Funded research cluster projects continue to 
amplify York’s international research excellence with projects 
that help to address complex global issues identified in the 
UN SDGs and beyond. Nurtured by this funding program 
and others, York researchers have been coming together in 
transdisciplinary teams to advance knowledge in a broad 
range of areas: measuring and analyzing common brain 
functions to advance diagnosis and treatment of all neuro-
psychiatric disorders; addressing the multifaceted natural, 
social and political issues underlying the pursuit of sustainable 
resource extraction in Canada’s North; utilizing geomatics to 
study the evolving effects of climate change on ecosystems 
and human populations; examining technologies, treatment 
and impacts of water contaminants on the environment 
and human health;  and understanding the pathway from 
colonial genocide to building just relationships.  The research 
cluster of data economy brings together researchers from 
multiple faculties at York with diverse expertise in disciplines 
such as data science, economics, information systems and 
law, to build upon our existing strengths and collaborate on 
important issues that will help lay the foundation of research 
and practice in data economy. York researchers are also 
helping to address complex financial technology (fintech) 
challenges from a similar socially relevant perspective 
integrating transdisciplinary research methods and engaging 
a range of sector partners.  Research in this area is highly 
established and collaborative and as such has been identified 
as a research cluster focus at the Markham campus.  It is 
underpinned by broad expertise that draws together insights 
from economic, legal, ethical and societal-technical angles.  
This is exemplified by those involved in the transdisciplinary 
exploration of digital currencies, where York researchers 
take an inclusive approach to exploring the technical 
aspects of governance, architectures, financial inclusion 
of underprivileged communities, and policy on regulatory 
frameworks for financial systems, including data and 
privacy regulations. 
Examining and addressing socially relevant challenges by 
crossing disciplinary boundaries is nothing new for York 
researchers who have gained considerable momentum and 
recognition over the past several years through the success 
of major collaborative initiatives.  These initiatives include 
Connected Minds: Neural & Machine Systems for a Healthy, Just Society that brings together our highly collaborative 
research team spanning neuroscience, engineering, arts 
and humanities with a diverse cadre of engaged partners, 
to understand and optimize societal benefits and mitigate 
risks of human-machine interactions. Researchers are 
also collaborating to consider the moral, ethical and legal 
implications of disruptive technologies on humanity and 
society as a holistic approach that is transdisciplinary in 
nature. In alignment with SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals), 
another exemplary initiative is the Global South Artificial 
Intelligence for Pandemic and Epidemic Preparedness and 
Response Network, an initiative establishing a multiregional 
network spanning Africa, Asia, Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa to deepen the 
understanding of how responsible AI solutions can improve 
public health preparedness and response. York’s 31 ORUs 
also serve as incubators for participatory research, adding to 
the richness and dimensions of transdisciplinary research at 
the University. York’s newest ORUs exemplify our strengths in 
technology, sustainability practices, artificial intelligence, as 
well as neuroscience and emergency mitigation, water, and 
technoscience and society – exploring areas from multiple 
perspectives. As an example, researchers from the ORU 
ONE Water are bringing together considerable knowledge 
and diverse perspectives to greatly enhance the capacity to 
address the ongoing global water sustainability crisis.  This 
ORU tackles several UN SDGs, such as SDG 6 (Clean Water 
and Sanitation), and enables diverse industry and community 
stakeholder partnerships, with a rich research pedigree 
in water sourcing, AI, water technologies, education and 
sustainability, resource recovery and reuse, as well as focusing 
on origins and outcomes of the environmental, educational 
and societal implications of water.     
Over the next five years, York researchers will continue to 
develop more novel transdisciplinary projects, continuing to 
break down disciplinary constructs and expand on research 
that considers and responds to socially relevant issues.  
Funding drivers like the Catalyzing Interdisciplinary Research 
Clusters program and additional supports for research teams 
at our Markham campus will assist with this commitment to 
further fuel and scale the evolution of York’s interdisciplinary 
research into a more dynamic inquiry approach. With the 
increased funding capacity and support for transdisciplinary 
research clusters, researchers will be able to accelerate 
the capacity of their fully launched research projects and 
initiatives and expect to pursue larger-scale external research 
funding as well as the development of broader research nodes 
and potential national and international networks. In addition, 
we will seek to expand more meaningful participatory 
engagement with aligned stakeholders and partners where 
possible and pursue new research partnerships across the 
spectrum.
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 25ENABLING STRATEGIC RESEARCH SUCCESS
Achieving the ambitions articulated in this plan will depend 
on an engaged research environment across the University, 
willingness, and availability of partners from industry, 
government, community, as well as on resources that 
are strategically invested to support research growth and 
development. We believe that an active, engaged research 
culture is integral to the fabric of our world-class University 
and fundamental to the success of our faculty and students. 
York is committed to prioritizing the development and 
intensification of internationally leading research across 
our institution as a means of enhancing the vibrancy of 
academic life and generating an exciting atmosphere for 
learning and scholarship. This begins with units, Faculties 
and the institution committing to investments in faculty 
complements that lead research, scholarship and creative 
activity at the University, and in students and fellows that 
help fuel the research engine. Equally important is a strong 
research support infrastructure, both in terms of research 
facilities, library research collections and IT infrastructure 
and in terms of collegial mentorship and a highly competent 
and dedicated research support staff. This support extends to 
research conducted in French as well as the promotion of the 
francophone research community, both within and beyond our 
Glendon campus.
York is fully committed to the ongoing development and 
success of our areas of strength in research, scholarship 
and creative expression, and will continue our impressive 
development as a leading Canadian research university 
through enhancement of our focused opportunity areas. 
Indeed, most of the resources supporting research at York 
has been and will continue to be devoted to the broadly based 
support of excellence in engaged individual and collaborative 
research and scholarship. The increasing engagement 
and success of our current researchers, the recruitment 
of outstanding new researchers, post doctoral fellows and 
students, and the expansion of the cutting-edge research 
infrastructure are the primary means through which we will 
achieve the ongoing development and recognition of our 
research, scholarship and creative activity. 
To better enable these goals, the office of the VPRI will 
lead the development of an implementation document as 
an addendum to the SRP. This document will provide an 
operational framework meant to enable the success of the 
SRP in achieving the aspirations of the University Academic 
Plan. The implementation document will help to assess our 
progress against the goals and objectives of the SRP; it will 
include recommendations for the strengthened delivery of the 
strategy as well as performance indicators to help focus the 
further development of research going forward. SUPPORTING RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT
York continues to prioritize its resources in support of the 
development of its research enterprise and has several 
initiatives underway that will continue to improve the 
institutional support of individual scholarship and collaborative 
research activities and programs. 
Smart use of new technologies, removal of cumbersome 
administrative hurdles and simplification of pathways to 
support research becomes imperative in this environment 
in order to facilitate our researchers’ success. We are 
working on an initiative to find efficiencies in current 
research administrative procedures through the reduction 
of bureaucracy and the introduction of paperless processes. 
Additionally, we are using previous internal research audits 
including the ORU audit and Innovation York audit to both 
track progress and inform our decisions. The VPRI is taking the 
lead to engage in continuous service enhancement towards 
a seamless pre-and post-award experience for researchers. 
A new research enterprise system will be acquired to allow 
for better workflow in optimal tracking of grant applications, 
external contracts and ethics protocols. Further, a DocuSign 
software system has been implemented to support electronic 
signatures and more efficient contract approvals and 
submissions. To address the changing nature of research data 
collation and output formats, we have acquired an electronic 
CV (eCV) solution to assist individual researchers and trainees 
in capturing and organizing their scholarly achievements 
efficiently in their own academic repository, as well as promote 
institutional and external understanding of the full depth and 
breadth of research, scholarship and creative activity. York 
University Libraries continue to contribute to these initiatives 
through use of the eCV, the promotion of the ORCID iDs and 
the Altmetric Explorer for Institutions platforms. 
From trainees to professor emeritus, investing in our 
researchers is the key enabler of research success, and 
time above all else is recognized as the most valuable 
commodity. Over the past several years York has accelerated 
faculty complement renewal and has increased supports 
for existing faculty as well as for new hires. For example, a 
more comprehensive research-related release program was 
initiated several years ago to enhance the amount of time 
available for faculty to engage in scholarly work. Investments 
in full-time faculty complement will continue and will help to 
strategically build research capacity across the institution. This 
includes attracting top talent through cluster hiring in areas 
of strategic importance to York, such as areas identified at 
our Markham campus and those supporting interdisciplinary 
research clusters. Additionally, we will look to expand our 
supports for researchers at all stages so that they may be 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 26able to safely conduct and disseminate their research and 
assist with mitigating risks, especially given more heightened 
visibility in online environments. 
Alongside our Canada Research Chairs that have been 
deployed to assist in building our research capacity through 
external recruitment, York has continued to evolve the York 
Research Chairs (YRC) program and build capacity to broaden 
and deepen their impact at York.  This program is an important 
component of institutional supports for research and seeks 
to build and intensify our leading research.  This program has 
evolved considerably since its establishment in 2015 – new 
equity, diversity and inclusion considerations are being put 
into practice and are now reflected within the adjudication 
process, including the makeup and training of the selection 
committee, the inclusion of equity action plans from nominees 
and best practice strategies to ensure a fair and transparent 
nomination process.  Additionally, a more tailored approach 
has been taken in developing the two adjudication streams –
STEM and SSHAD (social science, humanities, arts and design) 
– with nominees self-selecting their preferred stream for a 
more suitable evaluation. The YRC program continues to be a 
signature program that has enabled both increased researcher 
success and satisfaction and strengthened research 
leadership across the institution.
Building supports for researchers at key junctures in the 
research grant development cycle is another means by which 
York is supporting researchers and preparing them for granting 
success. Research Commons is York’s established research 
grant preparation mentorship program. In collaboration with 
other offices in VPRI, and Faculties, Research Commons offers 
research-focused grant clinics and workshops to faculty, 
research staff, post-docs and graduate students at York, with 
an emphasis on increasing Tri-Council grant applications 
and success by offering supportive skills and mentorship 
from experienced grant writers. We will continue to enhance 
and build on this successful program to meet the needs of a 
growing cohort of researchers at all levels, helping them to 
achieve a strong granting success rate.
York is committed to the ongoing expansion, ensuring a 
vigorous scholarly environment for our researchers, graduate 
students and postdoctoral fellows. We have one of the largest 
cohorts of graduate students in Canada and a growing number 
of postdoctoral trainees. Our graduate programs are growing 
in both numbers and quality, and an increasing number of 
our trainees receive support from the Canada Graduate 
Scholarships program, the Tri-Council and Mitacs fellowships, 
as well as from many other Canadian and international 
sources. York is one of the leading Canadian universities in 
holding awards and grants from the NSERC Collaborative 
Research and Training Experience Program (CREATE), which 
provides embedded partnered research experiences to 
trainees. Likewise, our postdoctoral cohort is growing in its 
recognition through national and international fellowship awards, and York is active in advocating for additional internal 
and external funding to attract and support postdoctoral 
fellows. The engagement of the University in a diverse range 
of research projects provides an environment that exposes 
our students to pioneering scholarship first-hand. This creates 
excitement and provides graduates and undergraduates 
with experiences at the cutting edge of their fields of study. 
York is committed to exposing all undergraduate students 
to practices of research and creation by involving them in 
research projects and the production of artistic works as part 
of their curriculum. As well, York offers internships and other 
opportunities to participate in and develop research projects 
over longer periods of time, especially for students considering 
more intensive higher research degrees. Additional supports 
for graduate students include the newly established York 
Academic Excellence Fund providing graduate students 
with upfront funds to advance their research and scholarly 
objectives through simple and timely access to financial 
resources.
York has made substantial investments in its research 
infrastructure over the past several years. As we continue 
to build and grow as an internationally leading, research-
intensive university, more research space is needed to 
support current and future research programs. York’s new 
iHive Building will offer both research and teaching spaces for 
science and engineering in addition to offering collaboration 
space for larger-scale interdisciplinary research programs, 
ORUs and other strategic research clusters. York is investing 
in large-scale interdisciplinary research programs to help 
build internationally recognized excellence in key areas 
of research such as Disaster Risk Governance, as well as 
seeding research collaborations relevant to the Markham 
campus and the Vaughan Healthcare Centre Precinct. These 
investments have been accompanied by the success of our 
researchers in bringing new research infrastructure and 
facilities to the University through the Canada Foundation 
for Innovation, NSERC and the Ontario Research Fund. 
Over the next five years, new investments in our research 
infrastructure will continue, with other infrastructure projects 
seeing completion. For example, the new Neuroscience 
Laboratory and Research Building serving the Faculties of 
Health and Science will expand York’s world-leading expertise 
in biological and computer vision with a new state-of-the-art 
facility in neurophysiology and research clinics in kinesiology 
and psychology. The new facility for the Advanced Disaster, 
Emergency and Rapid Response Simulation (ADERSIM) 
program will feature new equipment and technology to 
support our researchers, in addition to the completion of the 
new campus in Markham in 2024 and the development of 
additional partnerships in York Region. 
One way in which York strategically promotes the development 
of interdisciplinary research is through our network of ORUs. 
These ORUs advance research and collaboration across the 
University by providing a home for research development 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 27beyond traditional academic units. At the institutional level, 
ORUs are expected to align with the demonstrated strengths 
of York research and our strategic growth opportunities. 
Similarly, at the faculty level, ORUs are an overt expression 
of investment in specific research areas. We will continue to 
invest in the development and support of our ORUs in ways 
that will increase their grounding in the institution and their 
engagement with the external community. With targeted 
investments to raise their recognition and profile, ORUs will 
continue to be an important component of our efforts to grow 
internationally as a leading research institution and to increase 
York’s research brand recognition. 
York has a commitment to support open access in all areas 
of research and scholarship with York’s Open Access policy 
and YorkSpace repository. YorkSpace currently preserves 
over 35,000 scholarly works from a broad range of disciplines 
across the University and provides equitable access to its 
research. York is aligned with the tri-agency mandate to 
enable open scholarship through research data management 
planning and sound data stewardship practices. Many York 
researchers provide leadership in the editing and production 
of nationally and internationally renowned scholarly journals. 
Over 55 of these journals are hosted directly through the 
University Libraries’ York Digital Journals (YDJ) publishing 
program and are available through various models of open 
access. The YDJ provides a home for many unique journals in 
important and highly specialized areas of study. 
In furthering the growth of the international reach and 
recognition of our research, scholarship and creative activity, 
we are committed to facilitating the development and 
strengthening of internationally networked clusters of research 
excellence.  We are increasing our engagement in international 
research partnerships and exchanges, expanding our numbers 
of international graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. 
Furthermore, with a focus on proactive engagement with 
lower and middle income countries, we are supporting 
the co-development of global capacity to respond to the 
UN SDGs.  Going forward, this will require a targeted and 
coordinated institutional approach to advancing research, 
research engaged education and research expertise within 
the UN SDGs and beyond. We are continuously examining 
our approach to improving support for partnership 
development, strengthening our collaborations, generating 
more external funding to expand our influence, and initiating 
opportunities to attract and retain emerging talent from 
around the world. We have initiated the development of a new 
Internationalization and Global Engagement Strategy that will 
include an integrated focus on global research and innovation 
engagement.TRANSLATING RESEARCH INTO 
ACTION THROUGH INNOVATION, 
PARTNERSHIPS, KNOWLEDGE 
MOBILIZATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
AND COMMERCIALIZATION
York University has established a set of principles that guide 
our innovation support activities, driving partner engagement, 
collaboration, and greater societal impact from our research. 
These principles include:
• Research must be mobilized and translated to achieve its 
full impact on broader society
• Societal impact opportunities are enhanced through 
proactive engagement and collaboration
• Ongoing, long-standing partnerships support growth, 
knowledge integration and more rapid impact
• York’s role is to facilitate growth through expertise, support, 
training, mentorship and collaboration building, providing 
students and faculty access to tools and knowledge that will 
drive their work towards greater impact
York will support the development of all innovation 
opportunities, through the support of industry and community 
engagement and partnerships, knowledge mobilization, 
entrepreneurship and commercialization.
Partnerships and Collaboration
Over the past five years, York has continued to grow our cohort 
of scholars engaged in community and socially partnered 
research, increased the numbers and depth of partnerships 
with community organizations, the not-for-profit and public 
sectors, and extended our success in the SSHRC flagship 
Partnership Grants program. In the 2022 SSHRC Partnership 
Grant competition, York successfully applied for and received 
four Partnership Grants, which accounted for approximately 
20% of the national total.
At the same time, emphasis on meaningful partnerships 
between York researchers and the private sector has 
broadened the engagement of the University with industry. 
In part driven by growth of engineering and applied health 
and natural science, private sector partnerships have grown 
threefold over the past five years. 
In alignment with SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals), this 
growth trajectory is expected to continue as we work to realize 
our full partnership potential through individual and conjoint 
collaboration with partners from the non-profit, public and 
private sectors. York turns our research into action to benefit 
local and global citizens.
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 28Knowledge Mobilization
Knowledge mobilization advances social innovation through 
engaged scholarship and assists our partners in community, 
government and industry to address society’s most persistent 
social, environmental and economic challenges. Working 
closely with partners in the community, from NGOs to the 
United Way, from York Region to local and international 
partners in government, the Knowledge Mobilization Unit 
(KMb) at York is a national leader, garnering extensive national 
and international recognition and numerous awards for its 
work in mobilizing knowledge for broader socio-economic 
impacts. This includes engagement of social sciences, 
humanities, art and design (SSHAD) as well as research-
relevant policy and professional practice in all disciplines not 
only with community organizations but with governments and 
industry as well. 
These industries are major agents of positive change within 
our communities, in both the mainstream and marginalized 
sectors. York’s knowledge mobilization infrastructure supports 
multidirectional connections between researchers and 
research partners, encouraging the development of evidence 
that informs decisions about public policy and professional 
practice. A recent example is York’s contribution to the 
development of CIVICLabTO, an effort that brings the city of 
Toronto together with students, faculty and researchers from 
higher education institutions to address complex challenges 
through research and educational opportunities. 
Entrepreneurship
York University is deeply committed to fostering innovative 
approaches, technologies and perspectives to solve 
problems and promote global economic and social well-
being by supporting the commercialization of innovation 
through entrepreneurship. York has invested heavily in the 
entrepreneurship and innovation infrastructure over the 
past five years and has succeeded in establishing a healthy 
and engaged entrepreneurship community in which over 
2,000 students, faculty and staff engage annually. YSpace 
is York University’s premier hub supporting entrepreneurs 
in the community from ideation to scale. Our two priority 
sectors are technology and agri-food, in which we have over 
a dozen programs offered with customized mentorship, 
entrepreneurship education, incubator space and networking 
opportunities. As a part of our network, we have supported 
538 companies over the past four years within the consumer-
packaged goods and technology sectors, resulting in $67.5 
million of funding and generating over a combined $119 
million of revenue. At YSpace, each of our programs is built 
around the three core principles of mentorship, community 
inclusion and metrics-driven goal setting.The success of building an entrepreneurial mindset will be 
seen by growing the provincial and national reputation of York 
University as an entrepreneurial university, demonstrated by 
the growing number of students receiving entrepreneurial 
education, the growing number of start-up ventures 
supported, and the growing number of students graduating 
with an entrepreneurial mindset. In fact, our ELLA program, 
Ontario’s first accelerator focused on women-led product and 
serviced-based businesses, has recently received renewed 
funding for expansion across Canada to be delivered in 
partnership with other community-based organizations. In five 
years, we expect that the progress made will position York as 
a national leader in entrepreneurial education and outputs, 
as well as enhancing engagement in and prioritization of 
entrepreneurship at York.
Commercialization
The University has recently established a renewed 
commercialization strategy with the support of the 
Government of Ontario. This strategy will streamline the 
University’s support of innovation and intellectual property 
services to facilitate cost-effective commercialization 
opportunities for the York community and its partners. 
Through establishing this enhanced, full-service IP and 
commercialization pathway for York community and partners, 
the University will effectively support its faculty, students, and 
collaborating partners while building licencing and research 
partnership opportunities which drive greater impact and 
prosperity in Ontario. The University’s strengths in intellectual 
property through IP Osgoode and the IP Innovation Clinic, 
coupled with the support services in VPRI will enable rapid, 
meaningful transition of ideas and inventions through to 
market and social opportunities. These opportunities will 
be transitioned into entrepreneurship, innovation and 
partnerships to drive both economic and social growth for the 
University community and our partners. 
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 29SUMMARY AND EXPECTATIONS
Research, scholarship and creative activity are integral to the 
fabric of York. Their growth and development are among the 
highest priorities for the University. With a strong commitment 
to quality, social justice, responsibility and academic freedom, 
York delivers research that advances critical inquiry and 
scientific discovery, challenges our beliefs and perceptions, 
and affects the social, cultural and economic development of 
our country and beyond. This plan reflects York’s commitment 
to research excellence and to the development of new 
knowledge and creative activity. In moving us closer to 
achieving our research ambitions, implementation will be 
established through collegial discussion with our units and 
faculties as well as our external research partners as we 
develop and align research priorities going forward. Success 
will be measured through demonstration of growth in national 
and international recognition of our research, scholarship 
and creative activity, further acceleration of the strong pace 
of growth of our research funding and outputs, the success of 
our students, the recognition of our faculty for their scholarly 
achievements, and the benefits delivered to communities and 
society at large.
Strategic Research Plan 2023-2028 | York University — 30APPENDIX A: COLLEGIAL ENGAGEMENT AND THE STRATEGIC 
RESEARCH PLAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP 
This plan was developed through a broad process of collegial engagement with our academic community. From the summer of 
2022 to spring 2023, the York community participated in an open discussion about the role of research, our valuation of research 
and our aspirations for the future of research at York. This inclusive engagement process was guided by an active and dedicated 
Strategic Research Plan Advisory Committee that included representatives from across the University and the broader community 
and was active in reaching out and helping to further solicit input from the York community. In keeping with York’s practice of 
collegial governance, input from faculty members, students and staff was received through a series of community consultations and 
roundtable discussions on campus and through an active online site. Essential inputs into the Plan’s development were provided 
directly by the faculties through consultations with their councils, Faculty Deans and Associate Deans, and by members of the 
Indigenous Council, Organized Research Units, along with the Academic Policy, Planning and Research Committee of the Senate, 
as well as other research leadership bodies.
