RE:  University of Connecticut Strategic Plan:  2024 – 2034  
 
RECOMMENDATION:  
 
That the Board of Trustees adopt the University of Connecticut Strategic Plan:  2024 – 2034. 
 
BACKGROUND:  
 
The 2024 – 2034 strategic plan positions UConn to build on our recent history of excellence in academics, research, and outreach to continuously improve in service to our students and our communities.  
 
In preparing this plan, we engaged more than 10,000 people: students, faculty, staff, alumni, industry collaborators, friends of the University, and many others.  We collected feedback through surveys, forums, listening sessions, and a self -study led by a steering committee, working groups, and an 
implementation team.  We listened carefully to refine our vision, values, goals, and priority areas of focus, and we will continue to engage our community to ensure successful plan implementation. 
 
At its core, this plan centers students in our actions as an institution, signaling that when a student chooses to come to UConn, they will have countless opportunities to connect, learn, and develop. 
 
The strategic plan also promotes investment in our research enterprise to achieve the next level of excellence as an RI institution, leveraging the transformative work our faculty perform and produce across disciplines.  
 
In addition to capturing our goals and aspirations, this plan prioritizes fiscal responsibility and stewardship of resources, including increasing efficiencies and improving opportunities for internal and external collaboration.
