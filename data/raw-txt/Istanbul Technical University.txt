2022-2026  STRATEGIC PLAN7 6
One of the most obvious goals of ITU is to create value for our country by strengt -
hening the scientific and technological infrastructure through R&D and innovation 
studies. For this, while increasing the number and impact of qualified scientific re -
search, it also cooperates with public, industry and non-governmental organizati -
ons to develop new technologies and products and strengthen the human resour -
ces and infrastructure necessary for R&D. In this way, it provides both to monitor 
the output performance of graduate programs by increasing their academic acti -
vities and to increase the entrepreneurial potential of ITU students and graduates.
In addition to these, ITU plays an active role in informing and guiding the so -
ciety in social, cultural, scientific and technological fields. With the strengt -
hening of the Continuing Education Center and the Alumni Relations Office, 
in addition to the public information reports prepared on environmental and 
natural events, priority is given to the appreciation of the perception of ITU in 
the society and the brand value of ITU.
Our strategic goals also include making digital transformation permanent, inc -
reasing the visibility of our university by deepening internationalization activi -
ties, and making ITU a more preferred institution that plays an active role in the 
international arena. Moreover, strengthening the social life and communication 
in ITU campuses and finally developing the institutional structure that adopts 
continuous improvement by increasing the facilities of the campuses have a 
prominent place among our goals.
As we prepare excitedly for our 250th anniversary, which we will celebrate in 
2023, the 100th anniversary of our Republic, as an education and training insti -
tution, we have determined for ourselves a roadmap where digital transforma -
tion, internationalization, R&D investments and university-industry cooperation 
are always in focus.
I would like to thank all of our academics who have contributed to the preparati -
on of our 2022-2026 Strategic Plan, and I wish this step taken to strengthen our 
place among the best in the world with each passing day, to be beneficial.
Prof. Dr. İsmail Koyuncu
RectorIstanbul Technical University, with its deep-ro -
oted history of nearly 250 years; continues its 
activities without slowing down in order to ex -
pand the limits of knowledge in science, tech -
nology and art and to respond to the needs of 
society with its applications. ITU, which always aims at dynamism and innovation 
in education and training; thanks to its expertise and creativity in science, tech -
nology and art, it is on its way to become an internationally leading university. As 
ITU has accomplished great things in the past of our country, it also undertakes 
an eye-opening and guiding mission in the future. While aiming all these, it takes 
care not to compromise its human-oriented and open to differences, libertarian 
and critical, entrepreneurial and competitive, original and innovative values.
Following our 2017-2022 Strategic Plan, in which we set out our future vision 
as a Technical University, we have now prepared ITU’s 2022-2026 Strategic 
Plan in line with the opinions, suggestions and guidance of all stakeholders. 
The prepared plan includes the strategic goals of Istanbul Technical Univer -
sity, the goals that will enable ITU to achieve these goals, and the strategies 
to be used to achieve them, in the 2022-2026 period.
It would be appropriate to discuss our strategic goals, which we elaborated 
in detail in our report, which was prepared with a participatory approach, 
under one heading.
Due to its mission and vision, ITU always prioritizes education and training. 
In this sense, it aims to strengthen the physical infrastructure, to dominate 
multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary education and training, to have stu -
dents and teaching staff at international standards, to continuously improve 
undergraduate and graduate education and to increase its quality every year 
in order to make the innovative and dynamic education model permanent.RECTOR’S

Figure 1. Strategic Plan TimelineSITUATION ANALYSIS
In the first step of the 2022 – 2026 ITU Strategic Planning process, a situa -
tion analysis was made. Thanks to this analysis, information that constitutes 
input to our strategic plan has been produced.
Information on the situation analysis studies was obtained from different 
units apart from the Strategic Planning Subcommittee. The Institutional In-
ternal Evaluation Report (2020) and Administration Activity Report (2020) 
and Performance Program (2021) prepared for the evaluation studies of the 
Higher Education Quality Council (YÖKAK) are among the most important 
sources.

2022-2026  STRATEGIC PLAN17 16
CORPORATE HISTORY
The history of ITU dates back to the Ottoman period. In 1773, it was estab -
lished under the name of Muhendishane-i Bahri-i Hümayun during the reign 
of III. Mustafa. After this institution, which taught shipbuilding and cartog -
raphy, Mühendislikhane-i Berri-i Hümayun (Imperial Land Engineering) was 
established in 1795 in order to train the technical staff of the land army. 
This school started to provide education in the field of architecture as well 
as engineering education in 1847. Muhendishane-i Berri-i Hümayun, which 
was transformed into Hendese-i Mülkiye in 1883, took the name of Engineer 
School in 1909 and started to provide training on the training of civil archi -
tects and engineers.
With the establishment of the Republic, engineering and architectur -
al education was reorganized. The School of Engineers was organized as 
a school that provides education to cover road, railway, water works and 
construction-architecture branches. Engineering and architecture educa -
tion has been continued at the Graduate School of Engineering since 1928. 
He trained the necessary technical staff in the field of public works in the 
Republic of Turkey. This school turned into ITU in 1944 and became an au -
tonomous university in 1946 consisting of the faculties of Construction, Ar -
chitecture, Machinery and Electricity. Later on; Mining, Chemistry-Metallur -
gy, Business Administration, Shipbuilding and Marine Sciences, Science and 
Literature, Aeronautics and Space Sciences, Maritime, Textile Technologies 
and Design, Computer and Informatics faculties have grown, all faculties 
have been divided into departments and diploma-granting programs have 
been developed.
ITU trains engineers and architects who will meet the needs of Turkey in all 
branches of engineering and architecture, and who can also be competent 
at the international level. In the 1974-1975 academic year, two-stage educa -
tion was started at ITU, and in addition to the four-year undergraduate edu -
cation, two-year graduate programs began to provide high-level education 
in many profession. Currently, a large number of students are served with 
graduate and doctorate programs conducted by six institutes, namely En-
ergy, Eurasia Earth Sciences, Informatics, Earthquake Engineering and Dis -
aster Management, Aviation and Graduate Education Institute. It is aimed to 
train faculty member candidates.
ITU is also the house of artists home where talents are cultivated. In addi -
tion to the first Turkish Music and State Conservatory in our country, the 
Music Master’s and Doctorate programs, which started education in 1999, 
train important names in our music and bring them to the art world.16

LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS
The Strategic Planning Subcommittee of the Strategy Development Depart -
ment analyzed the laws listed below and made a legislative analysis.
• Constitution
• Higher Education Law No. 2547
• Higher Education Personnel Law No. 2914
• 5018 Public Financial Management and Control Law
• Technology Development Zones Law No. 4691
The legal obligations given to ITU by the legislation examined, the basis of 
these obligations, the determinations made and the needs that help formu -
late the strategies of the strategic plan have been designated. These needs 
can be summarized as follows.
• The number of PhD and Master’s student quotas should be increased 
as soon as possible. Restrictions in human resource planning should be 
removed.
• Allocating additional resources in the areas of specialization of univer -
sities and using these resources, removing the legislative obstacles en-
countered in the decision-making process, and granting the necessary 
permissions to make staff structures according to differentiation strate -
gies will facilitate universities to achieve their goals.
• Legislation should be regulated according to the studies of academic 
staff engaged in education and training and R&D. It is necessary to pro -
vide the necessary flexibility in terms of increasing the use of education-
al technologies.
• University-Industry cooperation should be increased, accredited labora -
tories should be supported, additional budgets should be provided for 
research activities and projects that will contribute to the society should 
be given priority.
ANALYSIS OF TOP POLICY DOCUMENTS
The following Top Policy Documents have been examined in order to list the 
aims, objectives, policies, priorities, measures and actions related to higher 
education. 
• Eleventh Development Plan
• New Economy Program 2021-2023 (Medium Term Program)
• Ministry of Industry and Technology 2023 Strategy
• National Science and Technology Policies 2003-2023 Strategy Document
• Higher Education Council 2019-2023 Strategic Plan
• Internationalization Strategy Document in Higher Education 2018- 2022ASSESSMENT OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN 
IN IMPLEMENTATION
A system design has been made for the implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of our University’s 2017-2021 Strategic Plan. A strategic plan 
“based on measurable and objectively assessable data” has been prepared, 
and the ITU Dashboard has been set up to measure and monitor it. The 
strategic plan, which was prepared by fulfilling roles such as “business con-
tinuity, increasing efficiency, instant auditing, effective sharing of internal 
information”, was monitored and reported throughout the period, with this 
structure, which is highly valued in order to follow corporate targets and 
ensure concrete progress.
Most of the objectives in the ITU 2017-2021 Strategic Plan have been suc -
cessfully achieved and in this context, many issues such as “human resourc -
es management, effective use of financial resources, education, training 
and research activities and improvement of physical conditions” have been 
implemented and have been reviewed in detail in terms of supervision. The 
5 goals and 15 objectives of these goals, 28 activities and 62 indicators 
included in the 2017 – 2021 Strategic Plan were monitored. For all 62 in-
dicators determined, the units responsible for the relevant indicator were 
interpreted by comparing the values of the beginning of the plan period, 
cumulative and the end of the plan period. In this interpretation, target re -
alization is considered successful if it is 90% and above, reasonable/accept -
able if it is between 80%-89.99%, should be improved if it is between 50%-
79.99%, and unsuccessful if it is below 50%. Of the 62 indicators, 29 were 
determined and interpreted as successful, 11 as reasonable/acceptable, 11 
for improvement, and 11 as unsuccessful.
Performance programs have been created every year by adhering to the 
Strategic Plans of our university. In this context, at the beginning of each 
financial year, the previous year’s data were evaluated and performance 
programs were presented to the public in order to monitor and measure the 
performance indicator targets and realizations of the target year.
The pandemic process that has been experienced throughout the world 
has adversely affected our daily life and therefore our University. No matter 
how much precautions have been taken to meet the needs, re-evaluate the 
operations, and realize the strategies and targets with flexible management 
studies, the impact of the pandemic conditions on the students and other 
stakeholders has been inevitable. Such extraordinary situations have been 
taken into account in the newly prepared 2022-2026 Strategic Plan.
2022-2026  STRATEGIC PLAN21 20

Human Resources Competency Analysis
Our university has trained manpower in terms of academic and administra -
tive personnel, each of whom is competent in their own field. The numerical 
data of the administrative personnel are given in Table 3, and the numerical 
data of the academic personnel are given in Table 4.
Foreign lecturers work in many departments of our university. Table 5 gives 
the number of foreign personnel.
When the number of vacant/full administrative staff of our university is 
examined, it is seen that there are 1024 vacancies. Within the framework of the opportunities provided by the state and the 
practices brought by the legislation, the personnel needs of ITU are tried to 
be met in the most effective way with the help of existing and newly recruit -
ed personnel. Our strategic and quality management policies, which are 
determined in line with the mission and vision of our university, are aimed 
to increase productivity with work processes that can be improved con-
tinuously. In the development of these goals, a planned human resources 
management is very important. Today, human resources management fo -
cuses on the importance of the human factor and displays an approach that 
values the needs, training, development and motivation of its employees.
Corporate Culture Analysis
ITU has a structured interaction mechanism to ensure the participation of 
internal and external stakeholders. Involvement of internal stakeholders has 
been defined in the current ABET and Unit Improvement processes and has 
a continuous structure in a cycle. In support of this, the Quality Commis -
sion was established to represent all units and internal stakeholders. In this 
way, all internal stakeholder representatives were included in quality and 
improvement studies and strategic planning studies.
In addition to these meetings, satisfaction surveys are announced on the 
website of our University and applied over the internet in order to receive 
the opinions of internal stakeholders (student, administrative and academic 
staff) on the quality of service provided, and forms are announced on the 
web page of ITU Quality Coordinatorship.
Decisions taken and practices made at the institution are shared with our 
students, one of our most important internal stakeholders, via the corporate 
web page, ITU webmail, Ninova and notice boards. In addition, students par -
ticipate in decision-making processes through the following mechanisms:
• Communication with students is provided through the representative of 
the student and clubs union.
• Student opinions are taken by conducting satisfaction surveys to measure ser -
vice quality on the basis of units (dining hall, library, etc.). Considering the com -
pletion time of the Quality Management Cycle and the education period of the 
students, it was decided to conduct these surveys once every two years.
• Regarding education and training activities, course evaluation surveys 
are conducted regularly, and opinions and suggestions about courses 
are collected.
“Help Tickets”, which is another feedback mechanism, is also used frequently 
because it is an active system and accessibility is more efficient. In this way, 
complaints/suggestions/evaluations are conveyed to the relevant unit and 
efficiency can be achieved by communicating more quickly.Table 4. Number of Administrative Staff

Corporate Performance Management
Performance Program has been carried out in our university since 2009 (https://
stratejigelisteme.itu.edu.tr/yayinlarveraporlar/performans-programi). Key indi -
cators of our university that will serve five strategic goals are also taken into 
account in university ranking systems. In addition to these, key indicators of Re -
search University in terms of research and development activities are followed in 
our University, which is a Research University in line with mission differentiation. 
It is aimed to adopt the unit research quality and improvement cycles and the 
indicators to be followed not only at the level of the Rectorate, but also on the 
basis of units. These indicators are monitored both on the basis of the Rectorate 
through the strategic management panel, and the indicators concerning the units 
are observed on the basis of units and improvement suggestions are defined.
Physical Resources Analysis
The fields of ITU, which continues its education and training activities on five 
different campuses in Istanbul, in and out of Istanbul by 2020 are shown in 
the tables below (Table 6, Table 7). Our university has a rich collection of 
library resources as shown in Table 8.
Information and Technology Resources
In line with the current monitoring of information and communication tech-
nologies, Istanbul Technical University aims to provide all its students and 
academic units with the most efficient information infrastructure that can 
be used in creative and collaborative work, and to maximize the use of in-
formation technologies in the work of administrative staff. In 2018, the “ISO 27001:2013 Information Security Management System” cer -
tificate was obtained. 14 policies and 20 procedures in the ISO 27001 ISMS 
documentation regarding the acquisition, recording, updating and sharing of 
information continue to be actively operated. ITU information systems are de -
veloped as an intranet. Management information systems have been serving 
since 1998 in a way that allows a transparent management that respects the 
security and confidentiality of information. Our centers related to information 
systems at ITU provide assistance and support with the principle of working 
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Financial Resource Analysis
Considering the budget of ITU, financial resources have been estimated 
in order to determine the objectives, targets, performance indicators and 
strategies in the strategic plan in a realistic way. For this, the medium-term 
financial plan was used, and extra-budgetary resources and resources after 
the first three years were estimated. In addition, the income of projects and 
activities financed from external sources (eg EU funds, foreign loans, etc.) 
in order to realize the aims and objectives of the university during the stra -
tegic plan period were also taken into account. Financial resource analysis 
is given in Table 9.Table 7. ITU Campuses and Areas

Academic Activities Analysis
When the relevant sub-headings of the Situation Analysis section are eval -
uated for the analysis of the academic activities of ITU, the following evalu -
ations can be made in the context of education, research, entrepreneurship 
and social contribution, which are the main academic activities.
Field: Education
İ25 engineering programs of ITU are accredited by ABET. With this 
accreditation, in addition to international recognition, the quality of 
education is equivalent to accredited universities in the USA and the 
diploma given is valid all over the world.
Our university carries out international undergraduate exchange pro -
grams for its students to study abroad and joint programs with Amer -
ican universities for its students to earn double degrees.
In order to contribute more to national and international development, 
different connections have been established with various segments of 
the society, especially the business environment, and students have 
been provided with practices in this field.
As a result of the efforts to increase the number of double major, 
minor, master and doctorate programs in order to expand interdisci -
plinary R&D, education and training, our University has 29 interdisci -
plinary master’s and 14 doctorate programs.Our university cooperates in education and training by bringing to -
gether its strengths with higher education institutions abroad recog -
nized by the Council of Higher Education.
Studies continue to increase the number of students benefiting from 
double major and minor programs in undergraduate programs.
Being aware of its social responsibility, our university will continue to 
train engineers who have a high level of knowledge, are compatible 
with the environment, can use resources effectively, respond to the 
current and future needs of society, can use and develop new technol -
ogies, respect ethical values, and compete with the world.
Field: Research, development and innovation
The main purpose of ITU in this field is to produce new ideas, develop per -
spectives and reveal new values by addressing the problems that await solu -
tions on a regional and global scale. In addition to meeting the need for young 
researchers with the young researchers it has trained, it also leads research in 
many fields, makes it a prototype and provides the development of Univer -
sity-Industry cooperation by preparing the necessary conditions for its pro -
duction and using the infrastructure of R&D units. R&D studies are carried out 
in order to evaluate, accept and support scientific research project proposals, 
which are conducted by faculty members of Istanbul Technical University and 
researchers who have completed doctorate or proficiency in arts education, 
to carry out services related to them, to monitor them and to evaluate the 
results, and to develop cooperation with income generating laboratories and 
industry by providing patent and license support to researchers. The number 
of these studies will be increased. In order to contribute to the increase of 
knowledge and technological development of our country, it contributes to 
the establishment of research infrastructures and strengthening of capacities 
in higher education institutions.

ation with public institutions and organizations, the private sector 
and international organizations. Training centers, which continuously 
disseminate emerging new information and technologies to industri -
al establishments and society at large, are an indispensable comple -
ment to this development. Istanbul Technical University Continuing 
Education Center has been contributing to the development of the 
university’s cooperation with the public, private sector and interna -
tional organizations by organizing educational programs apart from 
the formal undergraduate and graduate education programs of our 
university since 1997.
Student Life in Higher Education
The physical regeneration steps carried out in order to increase the quality 
of life at our university are continuing. Evaluating the world’s outstanding 
universities in areas such as infrastructure, energy, climate change, recy -
cling, water resources, transportation and education; GreenMetric, a plat -
form that creates global awareness on sustainability and environmental 
awareness; Our University, which has realized many innovations and firsts 
in our country with its Green Campus studies, has also registered in the 
international arena and declared that it ranks 71st among the world’s 912 
respected universities and 37th in Europe. ITU has become the pride of our 
country as the only Turkish university in the top 100.
Istanbul Technical University produces with its own staff in four main kitchens 
and serves four types of lunch in ten cafeterias during the academic year.
A total of 4.872 students are provided with dormitories in a closed area of 
103.130 m2 in total at our university.
In our university, health services are carried out through the Department of 
Health, Culture and Sports, and psychological counseling and guidance ser -
vices are also provided. Students, university employees, retirees and their 
dependents benefit from health services. Health services are provided in 
Health Centers and Health Rooms in five campuses of our University.
Basketball, volleyball, badminton, table tennis, handball, korfball can be 
played and fencing activities can be done at the ITU Ayazağa Sports Center 
facility. The classes opened by the Department of Physical Education are 
also held in this hall.
Students are allowed to rest, spend their free time, and engage in activi -
ties in areas of expertise that will contribute to their professional formation, 
through the Culture and Art Association and clubs..HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR ANALYSIS
Within the scope of the strategic planning study, the developments in the 
higher education sector, in which ITU takes place, were examined, the op -
portunities and threats in the sector were discussed, and how our university 
could using the opportunities in the sector and what kind of precautions 
could be taken against the threats were examined. 
In the first part of this analysis, which will shed light on which areas our uni -
versity should focus on and which differentiation strategies should be fol -
lowed in order to strengthen its leading position in the sector, the rising or 
falling trends in the sector were examined and determinations were made 
about where to head in the future. Sectoral trends were analyzed using a 
technique also called PESTLE, consisting of political, economic, sociocultur -
al, technological, legal and environmental dimensions.
The components that make up this structure in the higher education sec -
tor are competitors from other universities, stakeholders such as students, 
non-governmental organizations, public institutions, suppliers from which 
the university purchases products and services, regulatory and supervisory 
institutions including accreditation institutions such as YÖK and ABET.
The information obtained as a result of the sector analysis can be summa -
rized as follows.
• Opening postgraduate programs for priority areas, supporting interdis -
ciplinary projects
• Increasing the number of qualified graduate students
• Increasing the number of qualified foreign personnel
• Establishing international joint training programs for priority areas

DIFFERENTIATION 
STRATEGY
Differentiation strategy; it acts as a bridge between the mission, vision, and 
core values and the goals and objectives of the strategic plan by clarifying 
the issues such as positioning the university in the higher education sector, 
determining the competencies it wants to build, and how its perception and 
reputation should be.
POSITIONING PREFERENCES
ITU trains people who will meet the needs of Turkey in the field of archi -
tecture and all branches of engineering, and who can also be competent at 
the international level. In the 1974-1975 academic year, two-stage education 
was started at our university, and in addition to the four-year undergraduate 
education, two-year graduate programs and high-level education in many 
professions began to be provided. Currently, a large student population is 
served with master’s and doctorate programs conducted by six institutes, 
namely Graduate Education, Energy, Eurasian Earth Sciences, Informatics, 
Disaster Management, and the Aviation Institutes, and educating researchers 
and young faculty members that Turkey needs through post-graduate edu -
cation are intended to be trained. 
In this context, producing R&D outputs at a global level is among the main 
goals of our University.
ITU is a “Research-Oriented” university because of the preferences of the top 
management of the university, their historical context, and being chosen as a 
“Research University” by YÖK.
Additionally, it has been continuing to train engineers since its establishment 
in 1773. Qualified researchers are needed to become a world-class research 
university. Therefore, with this mission, ITU will continue to progress and de -
velop towards becoming a “Research-Oriented University”. In this context, 
ITU Faculty Members give priority to research activities and graduate pro -
grams in their studies, while giving importance to the education of students .SUCCESS AREA PREFERENCES
ITU has determined its positioning preference as a Research-Oriented Uni -
versity. ITU will attach importance to the development of product-oriented, 
high value-added, and innovative products in its research. When techno -
logical and environmental trends are evaluated and compared to other uni -
versities that make a similar choice, it will differ by focusing on the following 
areas:
• Artificial intelligence, big data analysis,
• Remote sensing,
• Control software and internet of things,
• Quantum computer technologies,
• Automation and robot technologies,
• Biotechnology and health sciences,
• Development of biomechanical and medical devices,
• Energy storage systems,
• Green Technologies,
• Environmental issues, climate changes, smart cities, and sustainability
• Disaster management and earthquake research,
• Polar studies,
• Sustainable energy sources,
• New generation advanced vehicle technologies (land, air, sea, electrici -
ty, hydrogen, autonomous, etc.),
• Defence industry,
• Space Engineering within the scope of the National Space Program,
• Advanced material technologies,
• Textile technologies and fashion design,
• Chemical technologies
VALUE PROPOSAL PREFERENCES
Value proposal is the set of services that our University offers and wishes to 
offer. When this service set is evaluated;
ITU will improve its services by making innovations in scientific project sup -
ports, University-Industry cooperation projects, educational methods, aca -
demic and administrative processes, and certification processes.
It will continue by increasing its research, development, laboratories, inter -
disciplinary projects, publications, training of master’s doctorate students, 
and internationalization.

Six Strategic Plans have been made at ITU since 2005. At ITU, the collec -
tion of Strategic Plan Indicators data, the generation and presentation of 
reports have been supported by information technologies. In the previous 
strategic plan period, ITU Dashboard was designed for the implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of the plan. This designed system will also be 
used in the 2022-2026 period to measure and monitor the plan. In addi -
tion, the collection, evaluation and monitoring of data will become more 
effective with the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, the work 
of which has started at ITU. This system, which is important for sustainable 
development; is a platform with performance indicator data, and will ena -
ble effective planning by providing up-to-date statistics, in addition to in-
stant updating of data by all relevant users, and collecting instant data over 
systems (YÖKSİS, ITU Personnel Automation, ITU Student Automation, ITU 
Space Management Automation, etc.). 
The Enterprise Resource Planning software, which we attach great impor -
tance to monitor corporate goals and to ensure concrete progress, will also 
fulfill roles such as “business continuity, increasing efficiency, instant con-
trol, effective sharing of internal information”.
The indicators in the strategic plan will be evaluated in 3, 6, 9 monthly and 
annual periods, and the level of reaching the targets will be monitored, and 
improvement activities will be initiated at the points where deviations are 
detected. The Enterprise Resource Planning software will be expanded to 
support performance monitoring and evaluation at all management levels, 
and will be able to provide data and information support for determining 
the quality issues related with University processes and improvement ac -
tivities.
Both the data coming from the Enterprise Resource Planning software and 
the 3, 6, 9 and 12-month evaluation results of the Strategic Plan will be 
discussed at the Annual Evaluation meetings of the Strategic Plan, which 
will be held twice a year by the ITU management, and can be used in the 
planning of the next year.
