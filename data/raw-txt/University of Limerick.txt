UL PRESIDENT
- FOREWORD
With a primary role of fostering and delivering health 
research in areas of academia, hospital care and community healthcare, the Health Research Institute (HRI) at University of Limerick (UL) flourished over the last ten years. 
Today and together with the mission, vision and core values of the new 
HRI five-year strategy, we stand on the precipice of an exciting and transformative journey, one that underscores the importance of fostering and delivering health research that reaches far beyond the confines of our academic institutions and resonates deeply within our communities and healthcare settings.
At University of Limerick, we take immense pride in our commitment to 
ex
cellence in research, education, and innovation. We understand that 
the health of our society is not solely defined by the absence of disease but by the presence of well-being, equitable access to healthcare, and the constant pursuit of new knowledge that can enhance the lives of individuals and communities. 
It is within this ethos that the Health Research Institute (HRI) operates, with 
an unwav
ering dedication to advancing the boundaries of inquiries into 
health and wellbeing through a unique transdisciplinary approach.
This new strategy marks a significant milestone in our journey to redefine 
the r
ole of academia in health research and we recognise that the 
challenges and opportunities of the modern healthcare landscape demand a departure from traditional silos and a new level of collaboration. The HRI embodies this shift, bringing together experts from diverse fields—ranging from medicine and nursing to engineering, social sciences, and beyond—to work in unison towards a common goal: improving the health and well-being of our society.

The transdisciplinary approach championed by the HRI is not a 
mere buzzword; it is a fundamental shift in our research paradigm. It acknowledges that complex health challenges require multifaceted solutions, and it encourages the free flow of ideas across disciplinary boundaries. By doing so, we unlock the full potential of our collective expertise, fostering innovation and creativity that can drive meaningful change in healthcare practice.
Moreover, what truly sets the HRI apart is its unwavering commitment to 
translational r
esearch. We firmly believe that the value of research lies not 
just in the generation of knowledge but in its translation into real-world applications that directly benefit our communities. Translational research is the bridge between discovery and practice, and the HRI is dedicated to ensuring that this bridge is robust, accessible, and well-travelled.
With sustainability at the core of this University and through the lens of 
t
his new HRI five-year strategy, we do so with a clear vision in mind: a 
vision where our research findings do not remain confined to the pages of academic journals but are integrated into healthcare practice, where innovation is not an abstract concept but a tangible reality, and where the health and well-being of our citizens are at the forefront of everything we do.Our commitment extends beyond the walls of our university. 
We recognize that true impact can only be achieved through collaboration with our partners in the healthcare sector, from hospitals and clinics to community healthcare providers. It is through these partnerships that we can bring our research to life, test its applicability, and refine it to address the ever-evolving needs of our society.
The institute’s membership of dedicated researchers: clinicians, and 
professionals, who have tirelessly contributed to the development of this strategy, and their unwavering commitment to the pursuit of excellence in health research, is the driving force behind the HRI's success.
Through steadfast determination and 
t
ogether, with our partners in academia, 
healthcare, and the community, we can forge a future where health research transcends boundaries, impacts practice, and ultimately transforms lives.

HRI DIRECTOR
- INTRODUCTION
The right to a healthy life does not start or end at a 
specific age. Enabling all people to live a long and healthy life requires a multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach. 
The Health Research Institute (HRI) at the University of Limerick (UL) was 
established to align researchers from different disciplines around common research goals with a focus on health across the lifespan and healthy ageing. We use an evidence-based approach to innovation and intervention and leverage digital technology to support the achievement of our goals. Key to this effort is the participation of patients and the public in our research. 
From initial small beginnings, the HRI has grown to be a major research 
institut
e, spanning UL and the University of Limerick Hospitals Group 
(ULHG) and interacting increasingly with the Mid-West Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO3). In the past four years, research clusters have helped vibrant research areas to grow and flourish; each cluster is associated with its own strong programme of research, leadership structure and planning process.
The HRI’s response to the global pandemic reaffirmed that the 
multidisciplinar
y and collaborative nature of our Institute can provide an 
adaptive and resilient response to new societal research challenges. This agility and diligence of the HRI community enabled new research studies to address the causes and consequences of the pandemic. 
The next five years offer an opportunity to build on the foundations laid 
in t
he development of the HRI. The Institute will maintain its resilient, 
multidisciplinary approach to research but will focus its efforts on identified research strengths that contribute to improved health across the lifespan. Focusing on these strengths will enhance research excellence, leading to more impactful research outputs and a greater reach, both nationally and internationally, for our researchers. Direct alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), particularly Goal 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing: Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages), will continue to make our research timely and internationally relevant.
Importantly, our plan involves working closely with valued partners, 
including ULHG, CHO3
, NGOs, companies, charities, funders and other 
academic institutions. Our work will continue to be collaborative with, and of value to, healthcare providers. Our new strategic plan will cement relationships with these bodies, thereby providing greater synergy and further opportunities for partnerships as well as having greater impact on these organisations. Moreover, we believe that working closely with other UL research institutes and centres, where relevant, is key to our success. Our members have excelled at developing international research networks, and we will strive to reinforce and enable these, thereby ensuring that international research funding and collaboration on outputs continue to expand and that the reach, significance and influence of the HRI is further enhanced.
An integral element of the HRI’s strategy will be to ensure that all activity 
is underpinned b
y equality, diversity and inclusion in accordance with UL’s 
Equality and Human Rights Strategy .
We look forward to supporting the HRI community and UL in r
ealising the HRI 
vision for good health and wellbeing over the next five years, and in so doing, bringing tangible health and wellbeing benefits to the people of the Mid-West and further afield.

ADDRESSING 
SOCIETAL GRAND CHALLENGES
SETTING 
THE SCENE
The Health Research Institute (HRI) was founded in 2014 to support, 
represent and promote health research at UL and to facilitate collaboration with the affiliated University of Limerick Hospitals Group (ULHG) and the Mid-West Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO3). 
ULHG comprises six hospitals operating as a single hospital system, 
and CHO3 provides community health and social services. Both bodies currently serve a population of 385,000+ in Limerick, Clare and Tipperary*. 
The foundation of the HRI was based upon the unique blend of research 
disciplines 
that emerged during the development of health-related teaching 
and activity across UL. The initial emphasis on research was defined by distinct research themes that provided direction and optimal collaborative opportunities. This emphasis was useful in the development phase of the HRI. As we progress and narrow our focus, these broad research themes will be replaced by a concentration on more specific priority research areas with critical, underpinning areas of excellence that have emerged naturally as a response to evolving societal needs and distinctive research expertise.
As a research institute that focuses on health, we have a keen sense of 
r
esponsibility to respond to and concentrate our efforts on the significant 
global health challenges that threaten our world. 
The identified priority and underpinning research areas (described below) 
ar
e aligned with global and national strategies that seek to address such 
challenges. The HRI and UL now have an inspiring and exciting opportunity to respond to these issues and make a real difference by delivering excellence in research powered and enabled by digital technology and data driven analytics at every opportunity.

We understand that being interconnected, interdisciplinary, cross-
boundary, cross-cultural and entirely inclusive in our approach is what is required to address societal grand challenges. We cannot do this alone or by using antiquated norms and attitudes.
The SDGs  were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal 
call t
o action by all countries to end poverty and other deprivations 
by, for example, improving health. Of the 17 integrated SDG goals, 
it is with SDG 3 – Good Health and Wellbeing: Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages – that the HRI focal areas of research are most closely associated. 
We have proven success and capabilities in the health and wellbeing 
space, wit
h recognised responsibilities and positive activity in gender 
equality and partnerships that provide the optimal platform for our five-year strategic plan. Our work supporting migrant communities’ involvement in research also illustrates our serious intent regarding the SDGs.
As the HRI embraces its responsibility with respect to SDG 
achiev
ement, it is imperative that we support the UL Mission-based 
Sustainability Framework 2030. Our alignment with the Sustainability Framework manifests most notably under Society-Thriving 
Communities, one of the four key areas of a sustainable university. As work on the framework progresses, we look forward to active participation that will help foster a true culture of connectedness, inspire research missions and, ultimately, manifest as real impact in society.
Our strategic direction was influenced by Horizon Europe, with 
Clust
er 1: Health, addressing health throughout the life course and the 
improvement and protection of the health and wellbeing of citizens of all ages. Cluster 1 refers to health technologies and the promotion of good health and wellbeing. One of five EU Missions in Horizon Europe relates to cancer.Setting the Scene  10  Setting the Scene  11  
On a national level, our focus and direction are fully informed by Impact 2030: Ireland’s Research and Innovation Strategy from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. This comprehensive and visionary document fits well with our research ambition through its emphasis on, for example, Horizon Europe; the Creating our Future initiative; the National Grand Challenges Programme, which will fund mission-oriented challenges and deliver impacts for society; and the new Evidence for Policy Unit, which will link public policymakers and the public research system.
The National Development Plan 2021-2030 from the Department of Public 
Expenditure and Reform has also informed the HRI strategy, particularly NSO 10: Access to Quality Childcare, Education and Health Services. The latter refers to the expansion of primary and community care as per Sláintecare, the objectives of which relate closely to the HRI vision, mission and goals (specified later). Sláintecare is a 10-year programme that aims to reform the healthcare system in Ireland. The Sláintecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023 places a particular emphasis on two prioritised Sláintecare reform programmes, one of which – Improving Safe, Timely Access to Care and Promoting Health & Wellbeing – shows how closely the HRI strategy matches the national healthcare agenda.

The Healthy Ireland Framework 2019-2025 is the national framework for 
action to improve the health and wellbeing of people living in Ireland while 
the Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan 2021-2025 provides a roadmap for working together to improve the health of the nation. As Healthy Ireland is a key initiative of the Sláintecare strategic action plan, this further validates our reasoning for direction taken and our identification of the most relevant areas of research excellence in the context of good health and wellbeing for all.
The strategic ambition envisaged by the HRI cannot be achieved in isolation. The Institute’s multidisciplinary and translational approach is an inherent and cultural strength that helps to promote collaboration amongst researchers, both from UL and partner organisations, and gives rise to research that has a meaningful and direct impact on people’s health and wellbeing.  
It is imperative that the current momentum is nurtured so that we can fully realise the true potential of the research base in the Mid-West and make a positive difference to people’s lives.
The HRI strategy is closely aligned with the integrated care aim of the new 
Regional Health Areas within the HSE. It is envisaged that the creation and implementation of six new Regional Health Areas will be completed in 2024. These are areas with clearly defined populations that geographically align hospitals with community healthcare services at a regional level; Limerick, Clare and Tipperary comprise Regional Health Area E. This new areas model will improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery and help to drive an effective, person-centred, integrated system. 
Health research in the HRI will continue to play a pivotal role in realising 
UL’s strategic priorities by driving the translation of research discoveries and knowledge into new, innovative ways of treating populations; delivering person-centred and integrated healthcare; changing behaviour; Setting the Scene  12   Setting the Scene  13  
incorporating digital technology; and improving health, health services delivery and quality of life in our ageing society. We have ensured that our strategy aligns with UL’s Research Strategy 2022-2027, Wisdom for Action by concentrating in particular on the mission-orientated challenge of building a healthy society. As most of our members come from our host faculty, the Faculty of Education and Health Sciences (EHS), we have ensured that our respective strategies complement each other.
The refined research portfolio will be defined by research prowess and 
identified opportunities for impact in the four priority research areas of ageing, cancer, physical activity for health, and food, diet and nutrition, all of which will be underpinned by expertise in implementation science and participatory and arts-based research and by our emerging skillset in digital technology and advanced data analytics.
In terms of a talent pipeline, the HRI is cognisant of the vital role the 
next generation of researchers will play in future-proofing a vibrant, collaborative and relevant health research ecosystem at UL.
The development of this strategy was informed by and validated through 
robust consultation processes and reviews, including with an external advisory panel, a quality review group and key internal and external stakeholders. 
As we approach the next phase of the HRI’s evolution and as we place an 
emphasis on research that provides the greatest opportunity for societal impact, we will ensure that the support system is effective and adequate for all stakeholders. Our new governance and management structure (described later) will support the effective implementation of the strategy.
We look forward now to the next five years as we strive to 
realise our ambitions of good health and wellbeing for all at all ages and to truly make a difference in this global challenge.

CLINICAL RESEARCH
SUPPORT UNIT
The HRI Clinical Research Support Unit (CRSU) was established in 2014. 
The CRSU is located within the Clinical Education and Research Centre (CERC), a building shared by UL and the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the University Hospital Limerick (UHL) campus. 
The CRSU houses a highly skilled clinical research team, including a 
clinical research operations manager, clinical research nurse managers, quality and regulatory personnel, a biostatistician and administrative support. The CRSU provides a dedicated space for clinical research and offers first-class facilities in the form of clinical rooms, hot desks, board rooms and meeting rooms. 
The CRSU supports HRI members in conducting clinical research projects and facilitates interaction with our healthcare partners. The Clinical Research Unit (CRU) was developed through our valued partnership with the HSE. This represents the CRSU team coming together with expert clinical research teams from the HSE to work collaboratively in the CERC to support externally funded clinical research studies in UHL and in satellite ULHG hospitals.
A critical element of the HRI strategy is to sustainably increase the number of clinical trials and studies conducted in the unit. This will be achieved through an ambitious but realistic plan that seeks to leverage the positive collaborative partnerships that already exist with ULHG clinician researchers. The CRSU link to CHO3 is strengthening, and we view this as a positive part of our work that needs to be nurtured. Industry links are crucial and will be expanded, again in collaboration with our ULHG partners and UL investigators and through the further development of our close working relationship with the Cancer Trials Unit, which is already highly active in the hospital. 
Whilst the CRSU is a modest, maturing clinical research facility compared to more established facilities in, for example, Cork and Galway, we do not see these entities as a collective threat but rather as collaborative partner members of a national network of such facilities. This brings opportunities in terms of expertise and best practice sharing and, indeed, service provision in niche areas such as data management and medical technology. We ourselves will develop our own niche area of expertise and use this to inform our business model, all the while ensuring that our plan is linked to local capabilities, opportunities and infrastructure.
The goals for the CRSU are to:
— support and drive the unit to achieve equal status with its peers; 
—  increase accessibility to trials for patients and healthy volunteers in t he Mid-West, or the new Regional Health Area E; 
—  improve support for investigators to increase investigator-led trials; and 
—  become a trusted destination for innovative studies utilizing digital technology, medical dev ice investigations and clinical 
data analysis, processing and management.Clinical Research Support Unit 14 Clinical Research Support Unit 15

The CRSU houses a highly skilled clinical research team, including a 
clinical research operations manager, clinical research nurse managers, quality and regulatory personnel, a biostatistician and administrative support. The CRSU provides a dedicated space for clinical research and offers first-class facilities in the form of clinical rooms, hot desks, board rooms and meeting rooms. 
The CRSU supports HRI members in conducting clinical research projects and facilitates interaction with our healthcare partners. The Clinical Research Unit (CRU) was developed through our valued partnership with the HSE. This represents the CRSU team coming together with expert clinical research teams from the HSE to work collaboratively in the CERC to support externally funded clinical research studies in UHL and in satellite ULHG hospitals.
A critical element of the HRI strategy is to sustainably increase the number of clinical trials and studies conducted in the unit. This will be achieved through an ambitious but realistic plan that seeks to leverage the positive collaborative partnerships that already exist with ULHG clinician researchers. The CRSU link to CHO3 is strengthening, and we view this as a positive part of our work that needs to be nurtured. Industry links are crucial and will be expanded, again in collaboration with our ULHG partners and UL investigators and through the further development of our close working relationship with the Cancer Trials Unit, which is already highly active in the hospital. 
Whilst the CRSU is a modest, maturing clinical research facility compared to more established facilities in, for example, Cork and Galway, we do not see these entities as a collective threat but rather as collaborative partner members of a national network of such facilities. This brings opportunities in terms of expertise and best practice sharing and, indeed, service provision in niche areas such as data management and medical technology. We ourselves will develop our own niche area of expertise and use this to inform our business model, all the while ensuring that our plan is linked to local capabilities, opportunities and infrastructure.
The goals for the CRSU are to:
— support and drive the unit to achieve equal status with its peers; 
—  increase accessibility to trials for patients and healthy volunteers in t he Mid-West, or the new Regional Health Area E; 
—  improve support for investigators to increase investigator-led trials; and 
—  become a trusted destination for innovative studies utilizing digital technology, medical dev ice investigations and clinical 
data analysis, processing and management.Clinical Research Support Unit 14 Clinical Research Support Unit 15

23 Priority Research Areas
PRIORITY
RESEARCH AREAS9.1  Ageing
Ireland has an ageing population. According to the national 
Healthy and Positive Ageing for All: Research Strategy 2015–2019 , by 2047, the number of those aged 65 and over 
is projected to increase from 531,600 to 1.42 million (or by 167%); and the number of those aged 80 years and over is expected to quadruple, from 128,000 to 476,700. Priority Research Areas
Ageing can negatively affect people’s health and wellbeing and presents 
challenges for society, health services and individuals. Research can play a vital role in helping to inform better policymaking and planning for this ageing population, which will help improve the lives of older people across the island of Ireland. The Healthy and Positive Ageing for All research strategy describes a set of research priority areas that focus on health services delivery, health inequalities, health behaviours and social care. 
The Ageing Research Centre (ARC) comprises an interdisciplinary group 
of r
esearchers, the aim of which is to conduct excellent research across 
disciplinary boundaries to address health research priorities that reflect the day-to-day realities of older people’s lives. Consequently, our research in this area is closely aligned with SDG 3, as described earlier.
ARC works to develop capacity in ageing research at UL and build 
collaborations wit
h researchers, clinicians, industry partners, older people 
and their representative organisations. ARC has a strong track record of public and patient involvement in research enabled by collaboration with a stakeholder panel of older adults and family carers.

9.2  Cancer 
Every year, 43,500 Irish people receive a cancer diagnosis. 
Even though more people survive cancer and live longer due to early diagnosis and new treatments, cancer remains one of the biggest killers in Ireland, causing 30% of all deaths.  
The Limerick Digital Cancer Research Centre (LDCRC) is a multidisciplinary 
collaboration between UL and UHL. It integrates experimental biology, high-throughput sequencing and spatial multiomics, sensors, digital technology, advanced computing and data science to study the fundamental biology of cancer and build computational platforms that support scientific discovery in preventing, diagnosing, monitoring and treating disease. Advanced data analytics in biomedicine differentiates cancer research in the HRI from other such initiatives.
Cancer patients are at the core of the LDCRC’s goals, and the centre will 
w
ork with them over the next five years to establish the academic and 
clinical infrastructure that supports world-class digital cancer research and an expanding portfolio of clinical interventional, observational and translational studies in haematology and medical oncology at UHL. 
The LDCRC will develop strategic national and international 
transdisciplinar
y partnerships to build a vibrant, dynamic research 
environment attracting outstanding scientific talent. The centre will continue to expand its external research funding portfolio and highly cited research outputs and will mentor new members and early-career researchers. LDCRC clinical and bench scientists will work with engineers, data scientists and computer science experts to advance data-driven cancer science with the goal of developing innovative approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment.
This dynamism and forensic focus are critical; the area is complex and 
pr
esents a significant sustainability challenge for healthy lives and 
wellbeing for all, globally.

9.3  Physical Activity for Health
Ireland has a significant public health challenge with 
few individuals adhering to the national physical activity guidelines. 
There is overwhelming evidence from public health studies that low 
levels of physical activity across the lifespan are associated with higher rates of some cancers, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and other morbidities and are a cause of early mortality. Consequently, the current low physical activity levels of Ireland’s population will affect people’s lifespan and quality of life and will have long-term consequences for health provision and the economy as a whole. 
The Physical Activity for Health (PAfH) research centre aims to improve our 
understanding of t
he long-term consequences of inactivity and to develop 
interventions and policy to improve physical activity levels across the population, thus aligning closely with SDG 3. The PAfH centre is building an international hub of excellence through multidisciplinary expertise, international renown for research excellence and capacity to meet global and local r
esearch, policy and practice challenges in the promotion of 
physical activity for health. PAfH research covers multiple settings across the lifespan, and its activities include research, collaboration, networking, capacity building and training.
PAfH’s goals for the next five years include extending links to develop more 
collaborativ
e research projects with clinicians; developing and expanding 
PAfH research funding streams, particularly EU funding; and placing a 
greater focus on publications in top quartile and decile journals. The centre 
will strengthen existing members’ research portfolios and will focus on mentorship of new members and early-career researchers in the field. 
PAfnH’s long-term vision is for the group to be recognised as a world leader 
in r
esearch excellence, with real-world impact in policy and practice.

9.4  Food, Diet and Nutrition 
The role of food, diet and nutrition in chronic disease prevention 
and management is particularly important as diet is a modifiable risk factor for most chronic conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
The increase in the prevalence of these chronic conditions is a societal 
challenge that requires multidimensional approaches, of which nutrition interventions are a critical component. 
Research and innovation in food, diet and nutrition have developed 
int
erdisciplinary critical mass and strength in the HRI across multiple centres, 
schools and faculties. Areas of strength span research on the impact of functional foods on health, performance nutrition, sustainable food practices and understanding the link between diet quality, chronic disease and healthy ageing. Principal Investigators in this area are leading on several national and international projects having received funding from organisations such as the Food for Health Ireland National Technology Centre; Enterprise Ireland; the Health Research Board; the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine; the Marine Institute; and the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund. HRI members have links to and are active members of the cutting-edge science and technology platform of the Dairy Processing Technology Centre, creating synergies for our newly formed Food, Diet and Nutrition priority area within the HRI.
It is now the aim of the HRI to prioritise and support the growth of this area 
b
y bringing together active and productive researchers with a food, diet and 
nutrition research focus and to provide clear links to existing centres (local, national and international), industry partnerships and, of course, related SDGs.
Over the next five years, this priority research area will seek to address the 
critical stages of t
he lifecycle and the health span by undertaking translational 
research that incorporates key interdisciplinary researchers and technologies in the development of functional foods and dietary strategies to optimise health using a bench-to-bedside approach. Food, diet and nutrition researchers will pursue a standalone programme of research and contribute to the HRI’s other priority research areas.

10.2  Implementation Science 
Implementation science is the scientific study of methods 
and strategies that facilitate the uptake of evidence-based practice and research by practitioners and policymakers, thus providing practical solutions to health services delivery and other challenges. 
Interventions and evidence-based practices that are poorly implemented 
– or not implemented at all – do not produce the expected health benefits. The field of implementation science seeks to systematically close the gap between what we know and what we do by identifying and addressing the barriers that slow or halt the uptake of proven health interventions and evidence-based practices.

erdisciplinary programme of capacity building, research collaboration 
and networking that strengthens academic and researcher engagement with implementation science and encourages the integration, application and sustainability of implementation science methods in future research endeavours within UL and beyond. HIST is focused on advancing research in implementation science and on the systematic uptake of evidence-based, technology-enhanced interventions into practice and policy across all priority research areas. It achieves this by encouraging and supporting the early integration of implementation science in all research projects, demonstrating the applicability and translational aspect of implementation science across disciplines, and conducting interdisciplinary implementation research. 
The cross-cutting activities of the group are aimed at supporting other 
r
esearch areas to employ implementation science methodologies in 
achieving impact across a wide range of projects in clinical and policy contexts. 
The HIST vision for the next five years is to further build expertise in 
implementation science r
esearch, to lead and support the embedding 
of implementation science into research culture and to gain national and international recognition as a leader in the field of interdisciplinary implementation research. Health Implementation Science and Technology (HIST) Website:  www

10.2  Implementation Science 
Implementation science is the scientific study of methods 
and strategies that facilitate the uptake of evidence-based practice and research by practitioners and policymakers, thus providing practical solutions to health services delivery and other challenges. 
Interventions and evidence-based practices that are poorly implemented 
– or not implemented at all – do not produce the expected health benefits. The field of implementation science seeks to systematically close the gap between what we know and what we do by identifying and addressing the barriers that slow or halt the uptake of proven health interventions and evidence-based practices.

10.3  Participatory Health Research
The goal of Participatory Health Research (PHR) is to 
maximise the participation of those whose life or work is the subject of the research, across all stages of the research process. 
Research is not done “on” people as passive subjects but “with” them to 
provide relevant information for improving their lives. Arts-based Research (ABR) focuses on the role of artistic practices as research methods to develop and sustain culturally informed, creative, whole-person research partnerships and projects. 
Work in the HRI within this area aims to ensure that our research is aligned 
t
o the needs of people. In line with UL’s focus on equality and human rights 
(EHR), equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) and the UN SDGs, one challenge being addressed in the HRI is that posed by the global phenomenon of migration and the importance of involving migrants in health research. The role of music and singing as culturally attuned methods to support migrants' involvement in health research is of particular interest here. 
This research area is represented by the newly constituted, interdisciplinary 
Par
ticipatory and Arts-based Health Research Unit (PAHRU), which is co-
directed by academic leaders in Primary Healthcare (School of Medicine) and Arts Practice (Irish World Academy of Music and Dance). The unit is a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Migrants’ Involvement in Health Research. 
Through the PAHRU, the HRI will continue to support the development of 
t
he National PPI Ignite Network (2021-2026), which is funded by the Health 
Research Board and Irish Research Council. 
With the ultimate goal of building capacity for public and patient involvement 
(PPI) in healt
h research on the island of Ireland, the PAHRU will conduct 
cutting-edge research to build evidence of meaningful and sustainable PPI over the next five years while driving a better understanding of the role of arts-based methods as participatory strategies for involving migrants in health research.

MEASURES 
OF SUCCESS
A critical element of any strategy is the output definition 
and measurement. The HRI KPIs, or success measures, align with the ambition for the Institute and for UL as a research-led university.
Our focus is on impact and excellence with challenging targets for quality and international co-authored publications and for citation impact. Awards success is critical, and over the lifespan of the strategy, we aim to increase such funding by 25% with a 30% increase expected for non-exchequer funding.
Capacity measurement is included, as are invention disclosures (IDs).
Activ
ity in the CRSU will also be measured.
To ensure transparency and consistency, we will use the UL Research Dashboar
d as the repository of most of the required information. The 
use of CRF Manager® in the CRSU will provide us with the required activity reports. This is a web-based resource management system used primarily for clinical research studies.
Close collaboration with the Technology Transfer Office will allow us to 
measur
e IDs, and the capacity measure (KPI no. 6) on next page will be 
recorded internally. In summary, with respect to its KPIs, the HRI will aim to:
1. Increase the proportion of publications  in top 10 percentile journals.
2. Increase the proportion of annual publications with international 
coaut
hors.
3. Increase Field Weighted Citation Impact  (FWCI).
4. Increase research funding income.
5. Collectively increase research funding from the EU and industry 
(none
xchequer).
6. Extend the HRI’s research capacity  by increasing the number of  
PhD
, Master’s Degree (MD) and Master of Research (MRes) students 
per member.
7. Increase the number of invention disclosures.
8. Increase the number of funded studies and trials supported by  
t
he CRSU.

IMPLEMENTING
THE STRATEGY
This strategy is underpinned by a comprehensive 
implementation plan. The development of the plan was informed by feedback gathered from key stakeholders using various mechanisms and platforms during the preparation phase.
The keys to successfully progressing the strategy are engagement, 
momentum, measurement and reporting, all of which form the basis of our implementation plan. 
The implementation plan will document the steps required to drive this strategy forward and, critically, will define roles and responsibilities. It will map the HRI journey to the achievement of our goals over the five-year lifespan of the strategy and will enable us to monitor, measure, act and, indeed, react when necessary.
The alignment of the strategy with UL’s strategic initiatives will ensure that our collective ambition fosters a positive, collaborative and synergistic institutional research ecosystem.
Responsibility for implementing the strategy lies with the HRI Executive Committee and the Management Team. Progress on achievement is key and will be assessed on a regular basis at Executive level with guidance from the External Advisory Board. 
Critically, frequent and transparent updates will be provided to our members with feedback and consultation on aspects invited regularly. This step is important to us as the members – the HRI community – form the very foundation of this strategy. Implementing the Strategy 44 Implementing the Strategy 45

GOVERNANCE
AND MANAGEMENT46  Governance and Management  47  
The HRI is committed to 
operating at the highest standards of governance.  
We recognise the absolute necessity for external strategic input to ensure that we are challenged, are aware of relevant developments and potential opportunities in fields outside of our normal sphere and are guided through our strategic implementation to ensure that the plan is achieved and remains relevant. 
To accomplish this, we will appoint an External Advisory Board with 
members from diverse and relevant backgrounds.
The revised HRI Executive Committee composition, which will be more 
broadly repr
esentative than heretofore, will concentrate on governance 
and strategy and will act as the decision-making body of the Institute. A new Management Team will ensure the strategy is implemented effectively and will work under the direction of the Executive Committee.
With definite lines of accountability and responsibility as part of this

ENGAGEMENT 
The HRI has several internal and external stakeholder 
groups, engagement with whom is key to the successful operation of the Institute and the advancement of our reach and significance agenda.
15.1  External Relationships
The HRI works closely with its external partners. Our aim is to expand the 
number of partners in a strategic manner and to nurture and develop all relationships. 
We are immensely proud of our collaborations with valued local partners 
ULHG and t
he Mid-West Community Healthcare Organisation. We look 
forward to investing more time and effort in developing these relationships for the benefit of all involved in healthcare in the Mid-West.
We currently collaborate with industry and see the potential to further 
dev
elop such partnerships. We plan to explore the mutually beneficial 
opportunities that exist with a view to broadening and strengthening our research portfolio.
In health research, studies often require participants with no health issues as 
w
ell as those who live with specific health conditions. Without these partners 
– our valued research participants – much of our work would be impossible. Taking an active part in a health research study is a significant and very personal decision for an individual to make. We recognise the responsibility associated with this partnership. The value we place on participatory health research is evidenced by making this area a key focus of our strategy.  
The person-centred work of our research groups has led to valued collaborations with NGOs, patient and advocacy representatives, charities and local community groups. The resulting interactions promote a nurturing environment for a research ecosystem such as ours and are the bedrock of our contribution to improving health and wellbeing outcomes for all. 
It is important to foster relationships that position us to be able to clearly illustrate how our research aligns with the principles and ambitions of Sláintecare and Healthy Ireland. In this context, we need to pursue avenues for consideration in policy and practice discussions. Therefore, we value all opportunities to interact constructively with governmental groups such as the Department of Health, the HSE, funding bodies and advocacy groups, and we actively seek such interactions.
We are delighted to be a member, through the CRSU, of the Health 
R
esearch Board National Clinical Trials Office, a national, integrated clinical 
research network for clinical research facilities/centres in Ireland. Through this network, we also interact with ECRIN (European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network), a not-for-profit intergovernmental organisation that supports the conduct of multinational clinical trials in Europe. These networks provide us with invaluable opportunities and learning experiences.
The HRI engages in mutually beneficial, collaborative relationships with 
ot
her third-level institutions and national clinical research facilities. These 
relationships allow us to effectively nurture study partnerships and to share skills and expertise.Engagement  48  Engagement  49

15.2  Internal Relationships  
 Our foundation and primary internal stakeholder group is the HRI 
membership. Comprising full (academic and clinical researchers) and postgraduate/postdoctoral members, the HRI membership represents a vibrant, dynamic community of researchers with a track record of impactful, relevant research and a serious focus on the next generation of health researchers. For more information, please visit the HRI annual reports web page: www.ul.ie/hri/about-us/annual-reports
UL institutes and centres, UL faculties and the Office of the Vice President Research are other important internal stakeholders of the HRI. Relationships with these stakeholders are vital to help ensure that our collective vision, mission and strategic objectives remain aligned and are realised. 
Because we recognise that working in silos is futile, we aim to nurture 
par
tnerships that extend across and beyond traditional disciplines 
and academic units with a view to realising our ambition of addressing global health challenges and improving quality of life. An example of this transdisciplinary work is exemplified by some members of the HRI community being active members of the UL Bernal Institute, which focuses on the scientific design and manufacture of structured materials, and Lero, the UL-based Irish Software Research Centre. 
We believe that by creating an open, inclusive research community, we can

not be possible. This is evidenced by the fact that our research groups are explicitly multidisciplinary.
BUILDING THE 
STRATEGY
While developing this strategy, we considered 
feedback gathered through initiatives and processes conducted during our extensive period of consultation.Engagement
The HRI underwent an external advisory panel review (2021) and an institutional quality review (2022) during the consultation period. These intensive reviews involved a deep dive of the strategic direction and operations of the HRI, encompassing surveys, workshops, focus groups, interviews, individual consultations and group work. In-depth reports with recommendations were issued after each review and were instrumental in helping us to define our direction. The findings of an external review of the HRI clusters were also considered as part of this work.
The consultation process involved seeking feedback from all members, 
int
ernal teams, ULHG (University Limerick Hospital Group) and 
community health partners – clinical and management, industry and internal and external stakeholders, as described above. 
We believe that this strategy is the result of a positive and engaging 
consultation pr
ocess and is a true testament to openness and 
transparency. We are sincerely grateful to and appreciative of those who joined us on this journey and, in so doing, helped us to shape the vision, mission and strategic direction of the Heath Research Institute for the next five years and beyond. 50  Building the Strategy  51  

15.2  Internal Relationships  
 Our foundation and primary internal stakeholder group is the HRI 
membership. Comprising full (academic and clinical researchers) and postgraduate/postdoctoral members, the HRI membership represents a vibrant, dynamic community of researchers with a track record of impactful, relevant research and a serious focus on the next generation of health researchers. For more information, please visit the HRI annual reports web page: www.ul.ie/hri/about-us/annual-reports
UL institutes and centres, UL faculties and the Office of the Vice President Research are other important internal stakeholders of the HRI. Relationships with these stakeholders are vital to help ensure that our collective vision, mission and strategic objectives remain aligned and are realised. 
Because we recognise that working in silos is futile, we aim to nurture 
par
tnerships that extend across and beyond traditional disciplines 
and academic units with a view to realising our ambition of addressing global health challenges and improving quality of life. An example of this transdisciplinary work is exemplified by some members of the HRI community being active members of the UL Bernal Institute, which focuses on the scientific design and manufacture of structured materials, and Lero, the UL-based Irish Software Research Centre. 
We believe that by creating an open, inclusive research community, we can 
suppor
t the creation of innovative ideas and solutions that would otherwise 
not be possible. This is evidenced by the fact that our research groups are explicitly multidisciplinary.

CONCLUSION
Since its inception, the Health Research Institute has 
developed into a vibrant, productive and relevant health research ecosystem with continually developing inter- and transdisciplinary strands across the university and, indeed, across the health research landscape in the Mid-West.
This strategy is borne out of lived experience, a robust deep dive of, 
and comprehensive horizon scanning for, the Institute. The result is the confirmation of four priority research areas with three underpinning areas of excellence that will collectively address the challenge of good health and wellbeing across the lifespan. 
With our strategic roadmap, we can now move confidently into the next five
