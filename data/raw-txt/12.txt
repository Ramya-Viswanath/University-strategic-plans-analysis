Macquarie is a university of service and engagement. We serve and 
engage our students and staff through transformative learning 
and life experiences; and we serve and engage the world through 
discovery, dissemination of knowledge and ideas, innovation and 
deep partnerships.
WE ASPIRE TO BE:
• a destination of choice for students and staff who share 
our values
• deeply connected with our stakeholders and partners,  
and known for this globally
• ranked among the highest-performing research universities  
of Australia and, for key disciplines, to be recognised globally  
for our pre-eminence
• known across Australia and beyond as custodians of a 
remarkable university campus that blends the vibrancy of 
a cosmopolitan university village with a setting of Australian 
natural bushland.
As custodians of the University, we value scholarship, integrity 
and empowerment.  We believe learning, enquiry and discovery 
improve lives; we conduct ourselves ethically, equitably and for 
mutual benefit; and we work to make our community a source of 
strength and creativity.
Through our actions, as staff and students, we live these values, 
and it is against them that we hold ourselves accountable.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COUNTRY
We acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land upon which 
this University is situated, the Wattamattagal people of the Darug 
nation, whose cultures and customs have nurtured, and continue 
to nurture, this land since the Dreamtime. We pay our respects to 
the Darug people and the Wattamattagal clan.
We also wish to acknowledge the Elders of the Darug nation, 
past, present and future, and pay our respects to them. We 
further wish to honour and pay our respects to the ancestors 
and spirits of this land, and humbly ask that all members of the 
Macquarie University community are granted with the capacity 
to wingara – to think, to learn and to walk safely upon this pemul 
– this land. The University continues to develop respectful and 
reciprocal relationships with all Indigenous people in Australia 
and with other Indigenous people throughout the world.

Introduction from  
the Vice-Chancellor
2020 BEGINS A DECADE OF NEW OPPORTUNITY
As we commence a new decade, the environment in which 
Macquarie University operates is shifting significantly. We enter 
the years ahead with both opportunity and challenge before us. 
Opportunity – to renew our University community, to accelerate 
progress towards realising our potential and to commit to new 
ways of working together to achieve great things. Challenge – to 
come together as a diverse community, to achieve more and better 
with constrained resources in an increasingly uncertain world, 
and to have the humility to recognise areas where we must be  
open to change and commit to it.
Some 56 years since our founding, Macquarie is a strong and 
resilient community. We serve and engage the world through our 
dual mission of providing transformative learning and teaching 
for our students, and of advancing discovery and dissemination of 
new knowledge through our research. For some time, we have been 
engaged in important, challenging and expensive long-term shifts 
– as we renew our areas of focus in education and research; adapt 
our approach to learning and teaching; and revitalise our campus, 
technology and ways of working. Our resources in the next half 
decade and beyond will be constrained by global events and 
trends, with the potential for low or no growth in our traditional 
sources of income and significant disruption to global mobility.  
These constraints will require us to continue to adapt and change – 
rekindling that pioneering spirit of innovation that founded this 
University and seeking new ways to work with increased agility, 
greater efficiency and a sharper focus on purpose.In the opening months of 2020, I, along with Executive colleagues, 
have been focusing my attention on engaging with the University 
community towards the development of a structured operating 
plan for the University. This plan will be the blueprint that 
prioritises our endeavours in the near to mid-term. I have also 
been reflecting on our shared ways of working, and on our 
structures and approaches to ensure we meet our collective 
responsibility for a strong and sustainable future for the 
University. I thank all members of our community who took the 
time to engage in the development of this plan and for your inputs 
that have brought us to its publication.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the globe, including 
our own local world at a time when we were finalising our  
four-year Operating Plan, it has shown us all very powerfully that 
our University community is indeed capable of remarkable and 
quick innovation. The plan takes into account the heightened need 
for focus on core areas as we chart our future together, including 
how we must adapt in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This is important work for us all, and I look forward to working 
with the University community as we build for our future.

1. Students first  
We will strengthen our commitment to explicitly focus on our 
current and future students – their education and their success. 
Achieving this goal means we will use recently developed 
frameworks and plans1 to drive an excellent experience and 
outcomes in every dimension of students’ interactions with 
the University.
Every decision regarding education and student experience  
will first consider the perspective of students and their success. 
This means that to foster our students’ academic achievement and 
success, we will prioritise and balance the size and composition  
of our student body, our coursework suite, our support of students’ 
learning and overall experience, our research capabilities, our 
higher degree research (HDR) program2 and our resources.STUDENT EXPERIENCE

This Operating Plan sets out challenges for us as a university 
community to do new and different things, and to rethink and 
reimagine our approach to the dual mission of education and 
research. Every aspect of this plan must be grounded in academic 
excellence, rigour and governance – balanced with innovation, 
contemporary approaches and digital enablement. In engaging 
with the University community, a range of ideas and suggestions 
surfaced that were linked to improving our ability to embrace 
emerging technologies to better connect, engage and collaborate. 
In response to that input and the operating environment, 
digital transformation has been added to the five fundamental 
commitments on which the initial Operating Plan engagement 
took place.INNOVATIVE, DIGITALLY
