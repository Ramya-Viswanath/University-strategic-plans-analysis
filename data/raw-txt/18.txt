Important statements by General Secretary Xi Jinping on the “Unique Nanjing 
University”
General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important reply to NJU's young scholars who have 
returned to China from studying overseas
The construction of the “Unique Nanjing University” has entered a period of 
opportunities, challenges, and breakthroughs2. The unprecedented COVID-19 epidemic has a far-reaching impact. 
1. External environment
Increasingly fierce competition between countries in education, science and technology, 
and human resources
2. Internal challenges 
The issue of mentality: the conventional way of thinking depending on past practices
The issue of human resources: the relative shortage of human resources
The issue of systems and mechanisms: the modernization of the university’s 
governance system and governance capacity lacks sufficient depth 
The issue of resource:  the relative shortage of development resources
3. From the perspective of overall strategy
The main contradiction:  the disparity between the country’s increasingly urgent need 
for science and technology and Nanjing University’s insufficient capacity to supply 
science and technology
Adhering to the  “Four Services” [1] and “Four Orientations” [2] and promoting reforms 
in quality, efficiency, and driving forces by solving the main contradiction
